The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least half your caster level.</p><p>You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts <i>suggestion</i>, your caster level for this casting of <i>binding</i> increases by 1. For each assistant who casts <i>dominate animal</i>, <i>dominate person</i>, or <i>dominate monster</i>, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to a third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a <i>binding</i> spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the <i>binding</i> spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the <i>binding</i> lasts. All <i>binding</i> spells are dismissible.</p><p>Regardless of the version of <i>binding</i> you cast, you can specify triggering conditions that end the spell and release the creature whenever they occur. These triggers can be as simple or elaborate as you desire, but the condition must be reasonable and have a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, Hit Dice, or hit points don't qualify. Once the spell is cast, its triggering conditions cannot be changed. Setting a release condition increases the save DC (assuming a saving throw is allowed) by 2.</p><p>If you cast any of the first three versions of <i>binding</i> (those with limited durations), you may cast additional <i>binding</i> spells to prolong the effect, overlapping the durations. If you do so, the target gets a saving throw at the end of the first spell's duration, even if your caster level was high enough to disallow an initial saving throw. If the creature's save succeeds, all <i>binding</i> spells it has received are broken.</p><p>The <i>binding</i> spell has six versions. Choose one of the following versions when you cast the spell.</p><p><i>Chaining</i>: The subject is confined by restraints that generate an <i>antipathy</i> spell affecting all creatures who approach the subject, except you. The duration is 1 year per caster level. The subject of this form of <i>binding</i> is confined to the spot it occupied when it received the spell. Casting this version requires a chain that is long enough to wrap around the creature three times.</p><p><i>Slumber</i>: This version causes the subject to become comatose for as long as 1 year per caster level. The subject does not need to eat or drink while slumbering, nor does it age. This form of <i>binding</i> is slightly easier to resist. Reduce the spell's save DC by 1. Casting this version requires a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a <i>sleep</i> effect.</p><p><i>Bound Slumber</i>: This combination of chaining and slumber lasts for as long as 1 month per caster level. Reduce the save DC by 2. Casting this version requires both a long chain and a jar of sand or rose petals. This is a <i>sleep</i> effect.</p><p><i>Hedged Prison</i>: The subject is transported to or otherwise brought within a confined area from which it cannot wander by any means. This effect is permanent. Reduce the save DC by 3. Casting this version requires a tiny golden cage worth 100 gp that is consumed when the spell is cast.</p><p><i>Metamorphosis</i>: The subject assumes <i>gaseous form</i>, except for its head or face. It is held harmless in a jar or other container, which may be transparent if you so choose. The creature remains aware of its surroundings and can speak, but it cannot leave the container, attack, or use any of its powers or abilities. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while metamorphosed, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</p><p><i>Minimus Containment</i>: The subject is shrunk to a height of 1 inch or less and held within some gem, jar, or similar object. The <i>binding</i> is permanent. The subject does not need to breathe, eat, or drink while contained, nor does it age. Reduce the save DC by 4.</p><p>You can't dispel a <i>binding</i> spell with <i>dispel magic</i> or a similar effect, though an <i>antimagic field</i> or <i>mage's disjunction</i> affects it normally. A bound extraplanar creature cannot be sent back to its home plane by <i>dismissal</i>, <i>banishment</i>, or a similar effect.</p></h4></div>"},

A dispelled spell ends as if its duration had expired. Some spells, as detailed in their descriptions, can't be defeated by <i>dispel magic</i>. <i><i>Dispel</i> magic</i> can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the <i>dispel magic</i> can take effect.</p><p>You choose to use <i>dispel magic</i> in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell.</p><p><i>Targeted</i> <i>Dispel</i>: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the <i>dispel magic</i> spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends.</p><p>If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell.</p><p>For example, a 7th-level caster casts <i>dispel magic</i>, targeting a creature affected by <i>stoneskin</i> (caster level 12th) and <i>fly</i> (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the <i>stoneskin</i> (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the <i>fly</i> (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the <i>stoneskin</i> would have been dispelled, leaving the <i>fly</i> intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected.</p><p>You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a <i>wall of</i> fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect.</p><p>If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster <i>summon</i>ed by <i>summon</i> monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.</p><p>If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a <i>bag of</i> holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this.</p><p>You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.</p><p><i>Counterspell</i>: When <i>dispel magic</i> is used in this way, the spell targets a spellcaster and is cast as a counterspell. Unlike a true counterspell, however, <i>dispel magic</i> may not work; you must make a dispel check to counter the other spellcaster's spell.</p></h4><h5><b>Mythic: </b>When used as a targeted dispel, this spell can end two spells affecting the target instead of just one. If the targeted dispel successfully dispels at least one spell, you heal 1d4 points of damage for every spell level of the dispelled spell. If you dispel two spells, this healing applies only to the highest-level spell dispelled. If you use this spell to counterspell, roll your dispel check twice and take the higher result.</h5></div>"},

Any creature caught inside a collapsing structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).</p><p><i>River</i>, <i>Lake</i>, <i>or Marsh</i>: Fissures open under the water, draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground.

By naming a particular being or kind of being as you cast the spell, you cause the <i>gate</i> to open in the immediate vicinity of the desired creature and pull the subject through, willing or unwilling. Deities and unique beings are under no compulsion to come through the <i>gate</i>, although they may choose to do so of their own accord. This use of the spell creates a <i>gate</i> that remains open just long enough to transport the called creatures. This use of the spell has a material cost of 10,000 gp in rare incense and offerings. This cost is in addition to any cost that must be paid to the called creatures.</p><p>If you choose to call a kind of creature instead of a known individual, you may call either a single creature or several creatures.</p><p>In either case, their total HD cannot exceed twice your caster level. In the case of a single creature, you can control it if its HD does not exceed your caster level. A creature with more HD than your caster level can't be controlled. Deities and unique beings cannot be controlled in any event. An uncontrolled being acts as it pleases, making the calling of such creatures rather dangerous. An uncontrolled being may return to its home plane at any time.</p><p>If you choose to exact a longer or more involved form of service from a called creature, you must offer some fair trade in return for that service. The service exacted must be reasonable with respect to the promised favor or reward; see the <i>lesser planar ally</i> spell for appropriate rewards. Some creatures may want their payment in ""livestock"" rather than in coin, which could involve complications.</p><p>Immediately upon completion of the service, the being is transported to your vicinity, and you must then and there turn over the promised reward. After this is done, the creature is instantly freed to return to its own plane.</p><p>Failure to fulfill the promise to the letter results in your being subjected to service by the creature or by its liege and master, at the very least. At worst, the creature or its kin may attack you.</p><p><i>Note:</i> When you use a calling spell such as <i>gate</i> to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it becomes a spell of that type.</p></h4></div>"},

Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores.

Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area. However, if a cabinet has three different drawers, each can be separately warded.</p><p>When casting the spell, you weave a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. A glyph can be placed to conform to any shape up to the limitations of your total square footage.

Identifying the glyph does not discharge it and allows you to know the basic nature of the glyph (version, type of damage caused, what spell is stored).</p><p><i>Note</i>: Magic traps such as <i>glyph of warding</i> are hard to detect and disable.

This damage is acid, cold, fire, electricity, or sonic (caster's choice, made at time of casting). Each creature affected can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. Spell resistance applies against this effect.</p><p><i>Spell Glyph</i>: You can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know. All level-dependent features of the spell are based on your caster level at the time of casting the glyph. If the spell has a target, it targets the intruder.

Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them.</p><p>If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of <i>protection from evil</i>), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.</p><p>This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i><i>magic circle</i> against evil</i> can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i><i>lesser planar binding</i>, planar binding,</i> and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection from evil</i> spell for that creature only.</p><p>A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.</p><p>A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional <i>anchor</i></i> spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor</i> effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle</i> does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle</i>, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.</p><p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle</i> more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.</p><p>This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.</p><p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional <i>anchor</i></i> spell on the <i>magic circle</i> during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor</i> holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle</i> for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle</i> prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding</i> spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.</p><p>This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil</i> and vice versa.</p></h4></div>"},

Then you can attempt to take control of a nearby body, forcing its soul into the <i>magic jar</i>. You may move back to the jar (thereby returning the trapped soul to its body) and attempt to possess another body.</p><p>The spell ends when you send your soul back to your own body, leaving the receptacle empty. To cast the spell, the <i>magic jar</i> must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body is, as near as anyone can tell, dead.</p><p>While in the <i><i>magic jar</i>,</i> you can sense and attack any life force within 10 feet per caster level (and on the same plane of existence).</p><p>You do need line of effect from the jar to the creatures. You cannot determine the exact creature types or positions of these creatures.</p><p>In a group of life forces, you can sense a difference of 4 or more HD between one creature and another and can determine whether a life force is powered by positive or negative energy. (Undead creatures are powered by negative energy. Only sentient undead creatures have, or are, souls.) You could choose to take over either a stronger or a weaker creature, but which particular stronger or weaker creature you attempt to possess is determined randomly.</p><p>Attempting to possess a body is a full-round action. It is blocked by <i>protection from evil</i> or a similar ward. You possess the body and force the creature's soul into the <i>magic jar</i> unless the subject succeeds on a Will save. Failure to take over the host leaves your life force in the <i><i>magic jar</i>,</i> and the target automatically succeeds on further saving throws if you attempt to possess its body again.</p><p>If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body, and the host's life force is imprisoned in the <i>magic jar</i>. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs does not allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't choose to activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities. The creature's spells and spell-like abilities do not stay with the body.</p><p>As a standard action, you can shift freely from a host to the <i>magic jar</i> if within range, sending the trapped soul back to its body. The spell ends when you shift from the jar to your own body.</p><p>If the host body is slain, you return to the <i><i>magic jar</i>,</i> if within range, and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If the host body is slain beyond the range of the spell, both you and the host die. Any life force with nowhere to go is treated as slain.</p><p>If the spell ends while you are in the <i><i>magic jar</i>,</i> you return to your body (or die if your body is out of range or destroyed). If the spell ends while you are in a host, you return to your body (or die, if it is out of range of your current position), and the soul in the <i>magic jar</i> returns to its body (or dies if it is out of range). Destroying the receptacle ends the spell, and the spell can be dispelled at either the <i>magic jar</i> or the host's location.</p></h4></div>"},

The meteor spheres leave a fiery trail of sparks.</p><p>If you aim a sphere at a specific creature, you may make a ranged touch attack to strike the target with the meteor. Any creature struck by a sphere takes 2d6 points of bludgeoning damage (no save) and takes a -4 penalty on the saving throw against the sphere's fire damage (see below). If a targeted sphere misses its target, it simply explodes at the nearest corner of the target's space. You may aim more than one sphere at the same target.</p><p>Once a sphere reaches its destination, it explodes in a 40-foot-radius spread, dealing 6d6 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.

Despite stemming from separate spheres, all of the fire damage is added together after the saves have been made, and fire resistance is applied only once.</p></h4><h5><b>Mythic: </b>The meteors created by this spell deal bludgeoning damage in a line extending from you to the target destination where it explodes. Creatures in the path of a meteor take 2d10 points of bludgeoning damage and must succeed at a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. The damage from the exploding meteors increases to 6d10 points of fire damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex saves against the fire damage are also knocked prone and deafened for 1d4 rounds.</h5><h5><b>Augmented (10th)</b>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, creatures in the path of a meteor also take 4d10 points of fire damage and the damage from the exploding meteors increases to 10d10 points of fire damage; this fire damage bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity.</h5></div>"},

If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).</p><p>You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.</p><p>The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals.</p><p>Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.</p><p>A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100 gp per HD of the creature called.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.</p><p>To create the trap, you must use a <i>magic circle</i> spell, focused inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell.</p><p>The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check (DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Charisma modifier). It can try each method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A <i>dimensional anchor</i> cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see <i>magic circle</i> against evil) to make the trap more secure.</p><p>If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you ever roll a natural 1 on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the spell's effect and can escape or attack you.</p><p>Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only to inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the creature cannot complete through its own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level, and the creature gains an immediate chance to break free (with the same chance to resist as when it was trapped). Note that a clever recipient can subvert some instructions.</p><p>When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.</p></h4></div>"},

Both these bonuses apply against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures.</p><p>Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the creature (including enchantment [charm] effects and enchantment [compulsion] effects such as <i>charm person</i>, <i>command</i>, and <i>dominate</i> person). This saving throw is made with a +2 morale bonus, using the same DC as the original effect.</p><p>If successful, such effects are suppressed for the duration of this spell. The effects resume when the duration of this spell expires.</p><p>While under the effects of this spell, the target is immune to any new attempts to possess or exercise mental control over the target.</p><p>This spell does not expel a controlling life force (such as a ghost or spellcaster using <i>magic</i> jar), but it does prevent them from controlling the target. This second effect only functions against spells and effects created by evil creatures or objects, subject to GM discretion.</p><p>Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by evil summoned creatures. This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded creature. Summoned creatures that are not evil are immune to this effect. The protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and touch the warded creature.</p></h4><h5><b>Mythic: </b>The bonuses to AC and on saves increase to +4.

First eliminate the subject's racial adjustments (since it is no longer necessarily of his previous race) and then apply the adjustments found below to its remaining ability scores. The subject of the spell gains two permanent negative levels when it is reincarnated. If the subject is 1st level, it takes 2 points of Constitution drain instead (if this would reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be reincarnated). A character who died with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being reincarnated. A spellcreature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell.</p><p>It's possible for the change in the subject's ability scores to make it difficult for it to pursue its previous character class.

The weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon with some <i>spiritual</i> significance or symbolism to you (see below) and has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a weapon, so for example, it can damage creatures that have damage reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures without the reduction in damage associated with incorporeality. The weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon returns to you and hovers.</p><p>Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus would allow it to. Even if the <i><i>spiritual</i> weapon</i> is a ranged weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment, and switching targets still is a move action.</p><p>A <i><i>spiritual</i> weapon</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i><i>spiritual</i> weapon</i>'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).</p><p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first time the <i><i>spiritual</i> weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p><p>The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a <i><i>spiritual</i> weapon</i> of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each alignment are as follows: chaos (battleaxe), evil (light flail), good (warhammer), law (longsword).</p></h4><h5><b>Mythic: </b>The weapon gains your choice of one of the following magic weapon special abilities: flaming, frost, keen, merciful, shock, or thundering.

The <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect.</p><p>Once triggered, the <i>symbol</i> becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol</i> only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol</i> is still active, it must save again.</p><p>Until it is triggered, the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> works normally.</p><p>As a default, a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i>'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.</p><p>In this case, ""reading"" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> to render it inoperative triggers it if the <i>symbol</i> reacts to touch. You can't use a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.</p><p>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.</p><p>When scribing a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the <i>symbol</i>'s effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.</p><p>You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i>, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbol</i>s of <i><i>death</i>,</i> and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.</p><p><i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>symbol</i> with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the <i>symbol</i>'s spell level). Of course, if the <i>symbol</i> is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the <i>symbol</i>.</p><p>A <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic</i> targeted solely on the rune. An <i>erase</i> spell has no effect on a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i>. Destruction of the surface where a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is inscribed destroys the <i>symbol</i> but also triggers it.</p><p><i>Symbol of <i>death</i></i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p><p>A permanent <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.</p><p><i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> and Disable Device to thwart it.

Dexterity and dodge bonuses to AC do not count for this calculation.

Creatures caught within a <i>web</i> become grappled by the sticky fibers. Attacking a creature in a <i>web</i> doesn't cause you to become grappled.</p><p>Anyone in the effect's area when the spell is cast must make a Reflex save.

The spiders don't leave the area of webbing. Destroying the web in an area destroys the swarm there as well, and completely destroying the web destroys all the swarms.</h5><h5><b>Augmented (5th)</b>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, the webs increase to a 50-foot-radius spread. Webs span any gaps between available anchor points in the area, possibly creating multiple non-contiguous webbed areas.

This lasts 1 day.</p><p>Multiple sacrifices can be made to affect a single conjuring, but the bonuses provided by this spell do not stack. Therefore, while you can make sacrifices to aid in summoning and bargaining with a creature, you cannot make multiple sacrifices (even of varying types) to enhance the same effect of a particular conjuration.</p><p>A sacrifice may consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including treasures, living creatures, or more ephemeral offerings. While this spell is not fundamentally evil, good-aligned creatures prove more selective in what offerings they accept, typically scoffing at blood sacrifices.</p><p>Many sacrifices are fundamentally evil acts, such as murdering a pious innocent to summon a fiend. Any creature might reject certain types of sacrifices, thus denying you the benefits of this spell, as the offering must appeal to the target-few outsiders would care for 2,000 gp worth of parchment, while 2,000 gp of diamonds would be widely coveted. The GM determines what sacrifices creatures find appealing.</p><p>The Sacrifice Effects table on the previous page lists a number of likely offerings, along with the bonus such gifts effect and the offering's equivalent value in gold pieces for the purposes of <i>planar ally</i>. Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, lives, or even changes in alignment.</p><p>Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish.</i> The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells.</p><p>Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the summoned creature's choice. The bonuses and values noted on the sacrifices table are guidelines for offerings; certain types of treasures or lives might prove especially valuable to specific creatures, with extraordinary sacrifices (like a potent artifact or the life of a high-level paladin) garnering increased bonuses.</p><p>You cannot make greater sacrifices than those noted on the table to gain increased bonuses or gold values. For example, you could not gain two permanent negative levels to gain a +16 bonus nor gain increased benefit from slaying 20 HD worth of creatures to pay for a 10 HD creature's service.</p></h4></div>"},

This spell cannot be combined with <i>imbue with spell ability</i> or similar spells to give a target more spells than the limit.</p><p><i>Example:</i> You cast this spell on your 5 HD fighter cohort after negotiating an appropriate contract, imbuing him with the ability to cast cure moderate wounds, magic weapon, and <i>shield of faith</i> once per day for 1 month. If he casts any of these spells, he recovers them when you prepare your spells. Until the contract ends, your 5th-level spell slot used to cast this spell remains expended and cannot be filled with a new spell. Because you imbued your cohort with a 2nd-level spell, you gain a +2 profane bonus to attacks, saves, and checks while the contract remains in effect.</p></h4></div>"},

Any creature that bears the coin gains a bonus or penalty (decided by the caster at the time of casting) on all Appraise, Bluff, Craft, and Profession checks. This bonus or penalty is equal to 1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). In addition, the coin can produce an effect similar to the spell augury once per day-its ?ip producing a weal (heads), woe (tails), or nothing result (landing on the edge). Potentially unknown to the bearer (if different from the caster), the caster can telepathically hear any question asked of the coin and, as a free action, influence the result as he chooses.</p><p> Mammon's Mantle: Making a sacrifice worth 3,000 gp transforms the coin into a kind of infernal aegis for any who swallow the coin. Upon ingesting the coin, the target gains a bonus to Charisma equal to +1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The bearer's blood also takes on a hue like liquid gold and runs slowly, granting him immunity to poison, disease, and aging effects, and causing him to automatically stabilize if reduced to fewer than 0 hit points. Additionally, the bearer can eat gold to heal himself, regaining 1 hit point for every 20 gold pieces he consumes (materials other than gold provide no bene?t). The coin's effects last for 1 day per caster level.</p><p> Gold Guardian: Making a sacrifice worth 6,000 gp allows the focus coin to animate nearby coins. When cast into a pile of 100,000 coins, an animate hoard forms under the control of the caster. The guardian serves for 1 month. After this month, coins begin disappearing from the guardian at a rate of 100 gp per day, reducing the creature's hit points by 1 per day. When the guardian's hit points reach 0, the guardian collapses and the focus coin is destroyed. Coins lost from the guardian can be replaced, restoring any lost hit points.</p><p> In addition to the effects of any of these offerings, should the focus coin be swallowed, any being sired or conceived by the creature while the magic is in effect is born as a tie?ing (bearing an indirect relation to Mammon himself).</p></h4></div>"},

Finally, you can move through water with a swim speed of 60 feet and can breathe both water and air for the duration of this effect.

A creature with a burrow speed can move through the wall using its burrow speed. An attempt to move through a <i>wall of lava</i> inflicts 20d6 fire damage. A <i>wall of lava</i> also radiates heat as if it were a <i>wall of fire</i>, although the heat from a <i>wall of lava</i> radiates from both sides.</p><p>Once per round as a move action, you can direct the <i>wall of lava</i> to erupt. This causes a plume of lava to fire at any target within 60 feet of either side of the wall, but reduces the wall's overall size by 1d4 5-foot square sections. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target, which takes 10d6 points of fire damage on a hit. Holes created in a <i>wall of lava</i> from this effect instantly reseal, reducing the overall size of the wall.</p><p>All damage inflicted by physical contact with a <i>wall of lava</i> continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure ceases, but this additional damage is only half that dealt during actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 5d6 or 10d6 points per round).</p></h4></div>"},

This wave of terrain undulates as it passes over the world, harmlessly lifting or stretching objects, creatures, and phenomena with a connection to nature but tearing through and damaging anything else it encounters. When you cast the spell you must choose the wave's type, either a tsunami or a swell. If you choose a tsunami, you create a 30-foot-high tidal wave of earth or water hurtling across the landscape that lasts for 1 round per level. If you choose a swell, you create a more controlled and gentle 5-foot-high wave that lasts for 1 hour per level. Regardless of its form or composition, the crest of the wave extends 10 feet in front of and behind you, and 5 feet per level to both your left and right. You can stand or sit on the crest of this wave without any fear of falling off it and can even lie down and sleep (or take any other actions you could take if standing on solid ground) as it travels. You can grant up to one additional creature per level the ability to safely accompany you on this wave.</p><p>When you first create the wave, you must choose its path by facing the direction you wish it to travel. Once you make this decision, you cannot change it. The wave, in either version, moves at eight times your base land speed. Any object, creature, or phenomena strongly connected to, or a part of, the natural world simply rises up and down with the wave as it passes, taking no damage or injury. However, anything else coming into contact with the wave takes either 6d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the tsunami) or 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage (if the swell).</p><p>The wave damages any manufactured object or structure. On the Material Plane, it also damages any creature of the aberration, construct, outsider, or undead type, or with the extraplanar subtype. Creatures with the construct or undead type take double damage from the wave. Other creatures, or creatures with even one druid class level (regardless of their type), are considered a part of the natural world and are unaffected by the wave. Note that on other planes of existence, what is considered to be a part of the natural world may vary at the GM's discretion.</p><p>The wave can travel up or down the sides of natural features so long as it does not exceed a 45-degree angle. You cannot alter the dimensions of the wave as it travels. If the wave encounters terrain that it cannot incorporate into itself, the wave simply flows over or around the obstacle (creatures riding the wave are harmlessly displaced to the side to avoid the obstacle) unless the terrain occupies one-half or more of the area of the wave's crest. In such cases the spell ends in 1d6 rounds as the wave falters and collapses, unless its duration would normally cause it to expire prior to that.</p><p>The momentum of the wave carries you forward through this new terrain without any injury until it collapses, at which point you suffer the normal effects of the terrain in which you are deposited. Terrain the wave cannot incorporate includes anything primarily made from fire (such as lava), air (such as an open cliff face), or something man-made (such as a city).</p><p>You can only create the wave if standing on the ground. You cannot create it when underground or on terrain that it cannot incorporate.</p></h4></div>"},

If you cast <i>harrowing</i> on another creature, you must remain adjacent to the target for the duration of the casting time. A <i>harrowing</i> must describe one set of events or course of action (for example, ""hunting down the pirate king,"" or ""traveling to Viperwall to search for a magic sword"") that the target of the spell intends to undertake at some point during the spell's duration.</p><p>If you have access to a Harrow deck, draw nine cards when this spell is cast. If you do not have a Harrow deck, you can simulate the draws by rolling a d6 and a d10 for each of the nine cards, as detailed on page 293 of this book. Record the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card's alignment matches the target creature's alignment. If the card and target's alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit's check. If the card and target's alignments are of the opposite alignment (see below), the card inflicts a -1 penalty on that associated check. If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit's check.</p><p>While penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the <i>harrowing</i> persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can ""spend"" at any time to modify that card's associated check. You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. Since all of the bonuses granted by a <i>harrowing</i> are luck bonuses, they do not stack with each other.

By selecting this feature, you may make your plane self-contained so it loops upon itself when a creature reaches one edge (see Shape and Size, <i>GameMastery Guide</i> 185). You may designate areas or locations on the edges of your plane where this occurs (such as a pair of secret doors or a path in the woods) or apply it to the entire plane.</p><p>Structure: Your demiplane has a specific, linked physical structure, such as a giant tree, floating castle, labyrinth, mountain, and so on. (This option exists so you can pick a theme for your plane without having to worry about the small details of determining what spells you need for every hill, hole, wall, floor, and corner).</p><p>You can make this spell permanent with the <i>permanency</i> spell, at a cost of 20,000 gp.

You are considered ""very familiar"" with your entire demiplane.</p><p>As a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, mage's disjunction, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> and making a successful dispel check.</p><p>If you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by the spell again to create a linked area between the two.</p><p>You can make this spell permanent with the <i>permanency</i> spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp. If you have cast <i>create lesser demiplane</i> multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting's area requires its own <i>permanency</i> spell.</p></h4></div>"},

A plane cannot be enhanced and impeded for the same kinds of spells.</p><p>Morphic: You may use <i>move earth</i> at will in your demiplane at one-tenth of the spell's normal casting time, and can reshape normal plants in the same manner (such as by twisting trees into a fence or humanlike shapes). You are even able to affect rock formations with this ability, though the casting time for this is only half normal.</p><p>Portal: Your demiplane gains a permanent <i>gate</i> to one location on another plane, which can only be used for planar travel. This location must be very familiar to you.</p><p>This <i>gate</i> is always open and usable from both sides, but you can secure it using normal means (such as by building a door around it).</p><p>Time: By default, time passes at the normal rate in your demiplane.

This has three effects.</p><p>First, the target is marked with a magical symbol visible only to members of your faith. This symbol indicates that the target has transgressed and that the faithful should not help it. Likewise, the target is not to be persecuted because of the mark (though this would not keep members of a lawful faith from imprisoning a known criminal if these crimes were known to have taken place after he gained the mark).</p><p>Second, the target is no longer affected by helpful spells cast by the faithful and is always treated as an enemy for the purpose of other spells cast by those of your faith. For example, <i>cure light wounds</i> cast by a member of your faith has no effect on the target. If the target were traveling with a cleric of your faith who cast <i>prayer</i>, that spell would penalize rather than aid the target, despite the target's friendship with the cleric.</p><p>Third, if the target is a divine spellcaster, a member of a prestige class of your faith, or otherwise has some ability because the target belongs to your faith, it cannot use those abilities while the mark remains in place. For example, a paladin of your faith would be unable to cast paladin spells or use lay on hands or other class abilities. The target can join another faith to regain the use of these abilities, but the mark remains visible to those of your faith, even if those of the new faith accept the target.</p><p>This powerful spell with no saving throw is used to punish severe transgressions that do not deserve death or when you prefer to be merciful rather than meting out a more severe punishment. However, the spell has one drawback that prevents it from being overused. If the target did not commit any acts or misdeeds against your faith, the spell does not affect it but affects you instead, even if you are innocent of the charges.</p><p>This potential backlash prevents inquisitions run by corrupt members of the faith, and it means that most accusations of misconduct are carefully investigated (and usually verified with magic) before this sentence is handed down.</p><p>This mark can be removed like any other curse effect. In addition, a member of your faith can use <i>atonement</i> to break the curse if he makes a caster level check against your caster level; <i>remove curse</i> also requires a caster of your faith and a caster level check to end the <i>reprobation</i>.</p></h4></div>"},

Blast barrier, however, has proven to be an exceptionally versatile spell as far as terrains are concerned, for it works equally well in swamps, deserts, or any region where the ground is soft or easy to shape.</p><p> When you cast blast barrier, you cause a rippling wall of loose earth, mud, snow, sand, or gravel to spring up in a designated space within the spell's range. This wall provides total cover to all Large or smaller creatures and objects. The barrier can only spring up in an area of natural, unworked ground. The energy that forms the wall's matrix is unstable, and you must concentrate to maintain the wall's shape. A blast barrier has an AC of 9, hardness 0, and 5 hit points per caster level. When a blast barrier reaches 0 hit points, or when you cease concentrating on maintaining it, the energies that maintain the barrier's shape fail with explosive results, sending sharp chunks of the materials comprising the wall and magical energy out along both sides. Any creature that is adjacent to a blast barrier when it explodes takes 2d6 points of slashing damage and 1d6 points of sonic damage per 3 caster levels (maximum 6d6). A successful Reflex save halves the total damage done. Spell resistance applies as well.</p><p> This instability can make using a blast barrier risky, but many of the spellcasters that pioneered the spell became experts at its tactical applications, often using the barriers to cover an escape while lobbing spells and parting shots, hoping to trigger the barrier's destruction just as their would-be pursuers approached.</p></h4></div>"},

For the duration of the spell, the ship can travel beneath the water as easily as it did above. While under the effects of this spell, the ship has magical propulsion that gives it a maximum speed of 120 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet (see the Skull & Shackles Player's Guide for details). The ship's pilot uses the normal sailing skill to control the ship while under this spell's effects, and can command it to dive and ascend as part of the vessel's normal movement. Despite the magical propulsion, the ship still requires its crew to perform its normal functions.  The spell protects the ship and all aboard from the dangers of drowning and pressure, but not from damage from outside obstacles or creatures. The bubble cannot be used offensively and prevents an affected ship from rising into a space that won't accommodate it (like a sea cave too small to contain it or under another vessel). Creatures can enter or leave the bubble at will, but those outside the sphere cannot be forced inside against their will, the sphere proving substantial enough that such creatures may choose whether to enter or to slip away along its sides. At the end of the spell's duration the bubble pops, causing a ship still underwater at that time to gain the sinking condition. This spell has no effect if cast upon a ship in water that cannot cover the vessel entirely.  Although largely beneficial, this spell can be cast on a ship whose pilot does not want to submerge her vessel. The ship itself uses its Will saving throw to resist this effect.</p></h4></div>"},

For the spell's duration, the target can use any of the following abilities as an immediate action, but only up to a total of nine times, at which point the spell ends.  Cat's Luck: The target can use this ability when it fails a saving throw. The target can reroll the failed saving throw, but must take the new result even if it is worse.  <i>Fortitude</i>: The target uses this ability when a critical hit or sneak attack is scored against it. The critical hit or sneak attack is negated and the damage is instead rolled normally.  <i>Rejuvenate</i>: The target uses this ability when it is reduced to 0 or fewer hit points. The target is instantly healed 3d6 points of damage. If enough hit points are regained to bring the target to positive hit points, it does not fall unconscious. If it is not enough to leave the target with positive hit points, the target automatically stabilizes. Both of these effects work even if the damage was originally enough to kill the target.  <i>Shake Off</i>: The target uses this ability when it is under the effects of any of the following conditions: blinded, confused, cowering, dazed, dazzled, entangled, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, sickened, or staggered. Using this ability ends one of those conditions.  <i>Shimmy Out</i>: The target uses this ability when it is grappled or pinned. The target automatically escapes the grapple as if it had succeeded at an Escape Artist check to escape the grapple.  <i>Stay Up</i>: The target uses this ability when it is tripped or otherwise knocked prone.

The space holds as many as 10 creatures of any size.  When this spell is cast upon a 5-foot-square part of a wall, it creates an extradimensional space adjacent to the Plane of Shadow. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden beyond the reach of spells (including divinations) unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as 10 creatures (of any size). The entrance to the extradimensional space remains visible as an area that is darker than the ambient illumination.  Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 5-foot-by-5-foot door or window were centered on the affected surface. The window is invisible (though it is within the shadowed entrance to the spell, which is visible), and even creatures that can see the window from the outside can't see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space is ejected when the spell ends. Only one creature may enter or exit the extradimensional space at a time.  The entrance is only open when the area around it is in dim light. Any other level of light (brighter or darker) closes the entrance, trapping creatures inside the extradimensional space. If the entrance is closed when the spell expires, there is a 50% chance that creatures in it are ejected into the Shadow Plane instead of the location of the entrance. If this occurs, the creatures appear on the Shadow Plane 1d10 miles in a random direction from their corresponding location on the Material Plane. The spell has no effect if cast on a plane that is not adjacent to the Shadow Plane.  Because the extradimensional space is adjacent to the Shadow Plane, any <i>shadow walk</i> spell or similar effect that allows travel to the Shadow Plane is more accurate, reducing the distance creatures arrive off-target by half.</p></h4></div>"},

As part of this spell's casting, you must cut one of your hands, releasing a stream of blood that causes you to take 1d6 points of damage. When you cast another spell in that same round, your blood transforms into one material component of your choice required by that second spell. Even valuable components worth more than 1 gp can be created, but creating such material components requires an additional cost of 1 point of Strength damage, plus a further point of damage for every full 500 gp of the component's value (so a component worth 500-999 gp costs a total of 2 points, 1,000-1,500 costs 3, etc.). You cannot create magic items with <i>blood money</i>.  For example, a sorcerer with the spell <i>stoneskin</i> prepared could cast <i>blood money</i> to create the 250 gp worth of diamond dust required by that spell, taking 1d6 points of damage and 1 point of Strength damage in the process.  Material components created by <i>blood money</i> transform back into blood at the end of the round if they have not been used as a material component. Spellcasters who do not have blood cannot cast <i>blood money</i>, and those who are immune to Strength damage (such as undead spellcasters) cannot use <i>blood money</i> to create valuable material components.</p></h4></div>"},

The target humanoid can be either conscious or unconscious, but must understand your language. Upon casting this spell, you must state a course of action you <i>wish</i> the target to take. This course of action must be described in 20 words or fewer. You must then state the condition under which you <i>wish</i> the target to take this action, also describing it in 20 or fewer words. Actions or conditions more elaborate than 20 words cause the spell to fail. <i>Unconscious agenda</i> cannot compel a target to kill himself, though it can compel him to perform exceedingly dangerous acts, face impossible odds, or undertake almost any other course of activity. You cannot issue new commands to the target after the spell is cast.  If the target fails his save against this spell, he is not compelled to act in any way until the specified trigger circumstances are encountered. He also has no knowledge of the details of the spell affecting him, and has no memory of the last 10 minutes (although he might come to notice the missing time or the presence of the caster). He can function as he <i>wish</i>es until the events you detailed as the condition take place. Upon experiencing the prerequisite condition, the target is forced to perform the course of action you described as per the spell <i>dominate person</i>. (If the compelled action is against the victim's nature, he immediately gains a new saving throw at a +5 bonus against the spell to end its effects.)

For example, if the target has been dominated by a vampire, you can use evidence left in the target's mind to learn about that vampire. Each minute you concentrate on the spell, you can learn your choice of one of the following pieces of information.  <i>Direction</i>: The controller's general direction and distance.  <i>Emotion</i>: The controller's emotional state (gloating, sated, frightened, angry, and so on).  <i>Image</i>: A powerful iconic image relevant to the controller or its connection to the target, such as a symbol on a door or a name on a gravestone.  <i>Location</i>: The controller's general location, such as ""in a large city"" or ""on a ship.""  <i>Name</i>: The name by which the target knows its controller (if any).  All of this information is based on the last time the influencing creature linked itself to the target, either to issue a command or to receive sensory input from the target. For example, if at nightfall a vampire commanded a dominated victim to walk to a cemetery, this spell can reveal the vampire's general location at that time, though it may have moved since then.</p></h4></div>"},

This works like a <i>scrying</i> spell, except you can only view creatures on the same plane as you. Each time you cast the spell, you can choose to see one of three types of reflections in your mirror.  <i>Known Mirror</i>: The current reflection in another mirror with which you are familiar.  <i>Known Person</i>: The current reflection of a person you know well, assuming that person is near a mirror.  <i>Known Place</i>: The current reflection of a place you know well, assuming the location is being reflected in a mirror.  You receive only visual information through this ability. You can choose to transmit information both ways so that a person reflected in the remote mirror can view whatever appears in the mirror you are using.  For example, Urion Petresky knows that Queen Elvanna keeps a mirror in a hall near her throne room. He can look through his own handheld mirror and see into this hall, even if the queen is not there. Alternatively, he can attempt to find the queen (wherever she is) by looking into his mirror; if, at that moment, the queen is near any mirror at all, he can see her. He may instead cast the spell and try to see into her throne room, hoping that someone has brought a mirror there. If any of these conditions fails, Urion sees nothing but his own reflection.  This spell works with intentionally fabricated mirrors only; it is not effective with other reflective surfaces, such as still pools or polished metal shields.

When this spell is cast, the subject may attempt a Reflex save. Success indicates that the vines fail to take root and the spell has no effect. On a failed save, the subject's base speed is immediately reduced by 5 feet. Each round thereafter, the subject must make another successful Reflex save or his speed is reduced by another 5 feet. This occurs each round until he is reduced to a speed equal to half of what it was before the spell was cast.  As a full-round action, the subject or an adjacent creature can tear the vines off the subject's body, resetting the speed penalty to just 5 feet, though the vines continue to grow each round thereafter for the spell's duration, requiring additional checks, unless it is actually dispelled. The spell's effects can also be prematurely ended by dealing at least 20 points of fire damage to the subject. When the spell's duration ends or the effect is terminated, the vines immediately wilt and the subject's speed returns to normal. Regardless of the subject's base speed, the vines cannot reduce a creature's speed below 5 feet.  This spell has additional effects depending on which version you cast, chosen when you cast the spell.  <br><i>Blessed Thorns</i>: The vines sprout vicious thorns made of celestial steel. Each round at the beginning of your turn, the subject takes 2d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage for each round since the creature last took a full-round action to tear the vines off. When you cast this version of the spell, you can also choose to make the thorns either cold iron or silver for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.  <br><i>Noxious Vines</i>: The vines emit noxious fumes that act as a lung and eye irritant. The subject and any creatures adjacent to the subject must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude check each round at the beginning of their turn. On a failed save, the creatures becomes blinded for that round and can't cast spells with verbal components.  <br><i>Swift Vines</i>: The vines act twice as quickly as normal, and slow the creature by 10 feet per round instead of 5 feet (though they still can't decrease the creature's speed to less than half). In addition, once the creature is slowed to half-speed, it becomes staggered until the vines are torn off or the spell ends.</p></h4></div>"},

Each ceremony provides a boon to two living, touched subjects for 1 hour per caster level, representing the divine gifts granted by your deity as well as the normal morale-boosting benefits of participating in an officiated ceremony. Bonuses granted by these boons are sacred bonuses if you channel positive energy or profane bonuses if you channel negative energy. (Bonuses in this section are referred to simply as sacred bonuses for ease of reading.) Only subjects whose alignments are within one step of your deity can be affected by this spell.  If you are using the downtime system from <i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign</i>, you may use additional resources to augment the effect of a particular ceremony. You may spend 10 Goods, Labor, or Influence or 2 Magic to create a larger ceremony and grant an additional boon that lasts for 1 day per caster level (up to a maximum of 5 days). The type of capital spent should reflect the preparation required for the specific ceremony. <i>Augmented</i> boons affect the creatures touched as well as a number of intelligent, properly aligned creatures within medium range equal to your caster level (up to a maximum of 10 creatures), granting all subjects the benefits of the original boon as well as the benefits of an augmented boon, representing the divine gifts granted to these witnesses by your god.  Unless otherwise stated, use-activated abilities are supernatural abilities and abilities that emulate the effects of a spell are spell-like abilities; in either case, abilities granted by a boon are generally usable only once or until the duration of the spell ends, whichever comes first. Spell-like abilities are cast at a creature's highest caster level gained, or, if the creature has no caster level, CL 1st. Constant or passive effects and bonuses granted by this spell can be dispelled as normal, using your caster level to do so.  <br><b>Funeral:</b> A funeral service must involve a corpse and at least one willing companion or next of kin. The subject gains a +2 sacred bonus against death effects.  <br><b>Holiday Fete:</b> A holiday fete may involve up to two willing creatures. The subject gains a +1 sacred bonus on Fortitude saves.  <br><b>Marriage:</b> A marriage must involve two willing creatures. The subject gains a +1 sacred bonus on saves against fear and emotion effects.  <br><b>Naming:</b> A naming must involve a willing parent or parents and a newborn (who is touched but unaffected). The subject can use <i>sanctuary</i> once.  The augmented versions of these four ceremonies are identical, granting the subject a +2 sacred bonus on all saving throws.

Unless otherwise noted, each of the following ceremonies requires at least two willing subjects.  <br><b>Air:</b> Celebration of Storms.

Second, the subject immediately receives another saving throw (if one was allowed to begin with) against any spells or effects that possess or exercise mental control over the target creature.

Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures of the chosen subtype in the same manner as detailed in <i>protection from evil</i>.

Each round that you continue to concentrate, you may ask the nalfeshnee one question and it will answer as best it can. If you ask a question about arcana or planes, the nalfeshnee has a +23 bonus to the skill check. If you ask about the Knowledge skill you selected, the nalfeshnee has a +20 bonus. It cannot answer questions pertaining to other Knowledge skills-to do so, you must cast the spell again.  Contact with Abyssal minds is dangerous, and each time the nalfeshnee answers a question, you suffer 1d4 points of ability drain to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (determined randomly) unless you make a DC 22 Will save. Each additional question you ask with this spell over the course of a single 24-hour period imparts a cumulative -1 penalty on this saving throw. Chaotic evil spellcasters always gain a +4 bonus on this saving throw.</p></h4></div>"},

For example, you might transform a desert to plains. To cast this spell, you must expend 10 uses of mythic power along with the material cost. This magically alters the area's climate and normal plants to those appropriate to the new terrain, but doesn't affect creatures or the configuration of the earth. Transforming rocky hills into forested areas converts grasses into shrubs and small trees, but doesn't flatten the hills or change the animals to suit the new environment.  You can alter the climate by one step (warm, temperate, or cold). The maximum extent of the terrain change is up to the GM, but in general is to a similar terrain type or one step within that terrain type (such as from a typical forest to a forest with massive trees or light undergrowth, from a shallow bog to a deep bog, and so on). You might be able to shift the land to a similar terrain type, such as turning a sparse forest into a relatively dry swamp. Local creatures adversely affected by these alterations either flee the area or quickly die, depending on their mobility and awareness of the change.  Multiple castings of the spell in the same area can create an area with radically different terrain and climate than the surrounding land. The GM can decide that certain terrain shifts are unsustainable and shorten the duration, or that some are suitable for the area and extend the duration.  This spell could have many secondary effects based on the nature of the change, the type of bordering terrain, and so on; these should be determined by the GM on a case-by-case basis. For example, transforming a desert requires drawing water up from underground to sustain the plants, which could deplete the water table in nearby areas. Creating a warm desert in the middle of a snowy tundra will create a bordering area of mud and frequent storms from the clash of hot and cold air fronts.  If you're at least 8th tier, you can expend 20 uses of mythic power instead of 10 to increase the range to 1 mile, the area to a 1-mile-radius emanation centered on you, and the duration to 1 month per caster level.</p></h4></div>"},

Furthermore, in dry areas, erosion may cause the flow of water to be blocked if the affected area is left untended before a sufficient amount of vegetation has grown around it to keep the soil in place.

A single casting of <i>aura alteration</i> is sufficient to mask all of the magic auras on the target.

The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. It must always be a flat plane, though you can shape its edges to fit the available space.  A <i>wall of clockwork</i> provides cover (+4 bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saves) against attacks made through it.  A <i>wall of clockwork</i> is 1 inch thick per 4 caster levels. You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 9. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 25 + 2 per inch of thickness. If an attacker an attack roll of a natural 20 (and only a natural 20, regardless of the weapon's threat range) and confirms the critical hit (even though the wall is otherwise immune to critical hits), that section of wall gains the broken condition. If already broken, that section of wall is destroyed instead.  Bronze created by this spell is not suitable for use in the creation of other objects (even for the limited duration of the spell) and cannot be sold.</p></h4></div>"},

You and the duplicate use the same statistics and share the same resources. If the duplicate takes damage, for example, you deduct the damage from your hit point total. Similarly, if your duplicate expends a charge or daily use from a magic item you both wield, the charge or daily use is expended from the item you carry. If you or the duplicate drops or gives away something you're carrying, the item disappears from the other body as well. This spell doesn't duplicate artifacts; any you possess remain on you.  You perceive sensory information from your body and that of your duplicate simultaneously. The spell enables you to process the sensations so you don't find them disorienting.  When you take any action, you choose which of your bodies performs the action, but both bodies share the same pool of actions. For instance, if you take a standard action to cast a spell,  you can use either body as the point of origin, but the other body can't also take a standard action that round. Likewise, if your duplicate takes a full-round action, you couldn't take a standard or move action. Both bodies can take any number of free actions as usual; for example, both bodies could say different things or each drop a different item. If either body doesn't move during the round, that body can either take a 5-foot step or move your speed once as a free action.  The two bodies are affected by attacks, spells, and effects as though they were one person, taking the worse effect when applicable (for example, if the bodies would be subject to differing effects due to being at different ranges). If both bodies are in the area of the same <i>fireball</i>, you would attempt the saving throw only once and take the damage only once. If one body is targeted by <i>hold person</i>, both would become paralyzed on a failed save. Both bodies count as a single creature for effects that target a specific number of creatures, and they can't be chosen more than once for such effects. You do count your other body as another creature for most combat effects, such as flanking or determining cover. However, you don't count as two unique creatures for the purposes of teamwork feats or effects you use that can target only creatures other than yourself.  Any magical effect with a duration affecting you has its duration halved while you're bilocating. For example, the <i>hold person</i> spell mentioned above would lose 2 rounds' worth of duration per round until your duplicate disappeared. If you were under an eagle's splendor e ffect t hat h ad 1 minute remaining when you cast <i>bilocation</i>, the effect would end after 5 rounds instead of 10. An effect shortened in this way lasts a minimum of 1 round total, and if an effect that lasts an odd number of rounds has 1 round remaining, it has its full effect on both of your bodies for that round.  When the spell ends, you decide whether you or your duplicate disappears. If you disappear, you become your duplicate. If you are carrying artifacts when you do this, they transfer with your consciousness.</p></h4></div>"},

Whether you summoned the chosen spirit or a deceitful replacement, the spirit can refuse to answer your questions or attempt to deceive you using Bluff, though in either case these spirits can speak about only what they knew in life and have no knowledge of events that occurred after their deaths. Malevolent spirits might take advantage of their limited physical abilities to cause terrifying spectacles designed to scare the caster.

You choose whether the mindscape is overt or veiled, and whether it's harmless or harmful. You can choose any shape and size trait, as well as any gravity trait (though you can't make it so the gravity is so strong it harms creatures within). The mindscape has normal time, no alignment traits, and normal magic.  You designate where both you and your subject appear. You don't need line of sight to draw the subject creature into the mindscape, but you must be aware of its presence within range. If you target an area with more than one sentient creature and you have never seen any of the creatures before (for example, if you know a group of soldiers is inside a barracks but you can't see them through the door), the subject of this spell is selected at random. If you have seen firsthand the creature you wish to target (continuing the example, if you spied the sergeant entering the room moments before), you can select it unerringly from among all the creatures. You must appear somewhere in your mindscape, though it's relatively easy to shield yourself from the view of any other creatures inside if they don't realize they're in a mindscape. You must also create a method of exit from the mindscape when you cast this spell, and that method must be possible to achieve based on the traits of the mindscape, even if it is obscure or difficult. The GM decides whether a method of escape is reasonable. Anything that would be a reasonable method of waking from a dream during deep sleep could allow one to leave a mindscape.  More creatures than the initial two can enter an existing mindscape, typically through the use of the <i>mindscape door</i> spell. You can create illusory creatures within the mindscape  but you're able to direct or concentrate on only one at a time. Only this creature is believable; any others largely remain silent or speak generic, repetitive phrases.  As is normal with mindscapes, you and any other creatures within the mindscape are unable to take actions within the real world, and your bodies lose their Dexterity bonuses to AC.  If you choose to create a veiled mindscape, the first time another creature interacts with the environment, it can attempt a Will save to disbelieve the effect. Disbelieving a mindscape reveals to that creature that it's within a mindscape and gives it the knowledge needed to leave the mindscape, but doesn't free it from the mindscape. For example, if you create a mindscape that takes the form of a parlor inside a stately mansion, and your target creature succeeds at its Will save, it gains the understanding that walking out the front door of the mansion allows it to return to its physical body, but it must actually move through the mental landscape of the mansion to reach the front door and exit in order to flee the mindscape. If the mindscape is overt, the creature automatically knows how to exit if it so chooses.  This spell ends at any time that you choose to depart the mindscape, freeing the target as well. Any creature that drops below 0 hit points while inside the mindscape returns to its body. If this happens to you, the spell also ends, freeing anyone still inside.  <i>Create mindscape</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 12th level or higher at a cost of 10,000 gp.

When trying to locate the <i>dream</i>scape of a creature known to you through a false identity, roll 1d20 + 80 on the table to obtain your results (instead of rolling d%), since there is no way for you to pinpoint the correct <i>dream</i>scape.  <br><b>On Target</b>: You travel to the correct creature's current <i>dream</i>scape.  <br><b>Off Target</b>: You travel to an area near the target <i>dream</i>scape on the Ethereal Plane.  <br><b>Other</b> <b>Dreamscape</b>: You travel to a similar creature's <i>dream</i>scape on the Dimension of Dreams.  <br><b>Mishap</b>: You and anyone else traveling with you experience a mishap during travel; each character takes 1d10 points of damage and must reroll on the table to see where it ends up. For these rerolls, roll 1d20 + 80. Each time ""Mishap"" comes up, the travelers take more damage and must reroll to see where they end up.  Regardless of the accuracy of your <i><i>dream</i> travel</i>, you and your companions all arrive at the same location (except in the case of a mishap). Mindless creatures can't use <i><i>dream</i> travel</i>, nor can creatures that can't <i>dream</i>.  You might be able to exit the <i>dream</i> near the creature on its home plane. If you and the other creatures are still in a <i>dream</i> when the <i>dream</i>er wakes up, the <i>dream</i>er can decide to bring you out onto its plane within 1d10 miles of itself. If it chooses not to, you and the other travelers are pushed into another <i>dream</i>scape or onto the Ethereal Plane. The spell ends when the creature wakes up, so you no longer have the option to dismiss the spell and return home. However, you do get enough warning that a spell is about to end that you can dismiss it before the <i>dream</i>er awakens and decides whether to allow you to arrive at its location.  You can use <i><i>dream</i> travel</i> to travel to the <i>dream</i> of a creature on another plane, but this requires trekking through the <i>dream</i>s of outsiders. It takes 1d4+1 hours of uninterrupted travel to reach the destination <i>dream</i>, and each traveler must succeed at a Will save each hour spent traveling in this fashion. The DC of this save is 10 for the first hour, and increases by 5 for each hour thereafter. If a creature fails this saving throw, it becomes shaken for the remainder of the <i><i>dream</i> travel</i> and for a number of hours thereafter equal to the amount of time spent using <i><i>dream</i> travel</i> to reach the destination plane. After the first time a creature fails the saving throw, one of the following effects occurs (determined randomly by the GM). These effects are considered emotion effects, in addition to any other descriptors that apply.     <table border ='1'><tr><th>d6</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Creature contracts cackle fever or mindfire (equal chance of either; see page 557 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook).</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Creature is cursed, as bestow curse; if the creature is a spellcaster, it instead acquires a random minor spellblight (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Magic 94).</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Creature is attacked by a phantasmal killer, and is treated as having failed the initial saving throw to disbelieve it. The Fortitude save DC is equal to the Will save DC that the creature failed.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Creature is possessed as possession (see page 181) by an outsider (50% chance to be a creature from the destination plane; otherwise, it is a random hostile outsider).</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Creature is affected as feeblemind.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Creature is affected as insanity.</td></tr></table>     Traveling to a different planar destination decreases the accuracy of your <i>dream</i> transit. If you exit a creature's <i>dream</i> onto a plane different from the plane you started on, you end up in a random location on the destination plane.  If the target of your <i><i>dream</i> travel</i> isn't <i>dream</i>ing, you and the other travelers can wait on the Dimension of Dreams until that creature begins sleeping. For each hour that passes during this wait, each <i><i>dream</i> travel</i>er must attempt a Will save as if it were traveling to reach another plane.</p></h4></div>"},

Only you can pilot the vessel, and you can do so even if you aren't inside it. Your psychic vehicle buffers minds from the intense emotional tides of the Dimension of Dreams, rendering everyone inside immune to harmful emotion and fear effects. Unlike with <i><i>dream</i> travel</i>, there is no chance the vessel arrives off target. In addition, you need not have met the target creature, but in that case you must have at least a reliable description of it. However, if you attempt to travel there with insufficient or incorrect information, you do need to roll, using the false identity entry from <i><i>dream</i> travel</i>.  Creatures that disembark from your vehicle can either enter the <i>dream</i>scape or exit to the plane where the <i>dream</i>er's body lies, arriving within 1 mile of the <i>dream</i>er's body. All creatures that disembark from the vehicle onto a plane at the same time arrive in the same place. The <i>dream</i>er can't prevent the <i><i>dream</i> voyage</i>rs from entering its <i>dream</i>, but can attempt a Will save to prevent a group of creatures from exiting to the plane where its body resides.  The psychic vehicle remains in the <i>dream</i> for the remainder of the spell's duration, even if it's unoccupied. A creature adjacent to the <i>dream</i>er can reenter the <i>dream</i> vessel as a full-round action through an illusory portal only subjects of the spell can see. You can return the vessel to the point where you cast <i><i>dream</i> voyage</i> to allow any number of passengers to return to that plane, and can return it to the <i>dream</i> again. Either of these trips takes the same amount of time as the initial travel, and can be done any number of times within the spell's duration. If the vessel moves out of a <i>dream</i>scape, companions left behind can't return to the vessel by being near the <i>dream</i>er. If a companion is killed, its body doesn't return to the <i><i>dream</i> voyage</i> unless you carry it with you, just like any other object.  If the <i>dream</i>er awakens while the <i>dream</i> vessel is still in its <i>dream</i>, it can allow the <i><i>dream</i> travel</i>ers to exit or not (as with <i><i>dream</i> travel</i>). The <i>dream</i> vessel remains intact in the Dimension of Dreams for the spell's duration even if it's untethered from a  <i>dream</i>. It drifts through <i>dream</i>s when this happens, and you can't pilot it to another <i>dream</i> (even a <i>dream</i> of the initial <i>dream</i>er if that creature begins <i>dream</i>ing again). If you dismiss the spell at any time, you and all subjects within the <i>dream</i> vessel return to where you started on the Material Plane.  You can increase the number of companions you can bring on a <i><i>dream</i> voyage</i> to 10 creatures per caster level, though to do so you must increase the casting time, maintaining your concentration and touching up to 6 creatures per round as a full-round action. If your concentration is disrupted before you touch all of the targets, the spell is wasted and has no effect. Once you have touched all of your companions, the <i><i>dream</i> voyage</i> begins; however, its duration is reduced to 1 hour.</p></h4></div>"},

If the target fails this saving throw, the tendril is more restrictive, making the target grappled and dealing it 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage.

The ectoplasmic tether has hardness 10 and a number of hit points equal to 10 + your caster level + your Constitution modifier, and the tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere along its length. You are not considered to have the grappled condition while tethered to the target.

This doorway takes on any form of your choosing, but can be no larger than a 5-foot cube. This spell has different effects depending on whether you are inside a mindscape when you cast it.  When you cast this spell outside a mindscape, the doorway connects to one mindscape inhabited by a creature of your choice within close range (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 levels) of the door. That creature becomes the door's conduit, but can attempt a Will save to deny access to the mindscape. You must be aware of the mindscape to connect a <i>mindscape door</i> to it. If you connect to the mindscape, you designate any number of creatures to be able to see and pass through the door as though it were a normal doorway. You can name specific creatures or categories of creatures, or allow all creatures access. Creatures other than those you designate can't perceive or use the door, nor can mindless creatures or those immune to mind-affecting effects. Once anyone enters the mindscape through the door, a duplicate of the door appears inside the mindscape next to the creature you used as a conduit. Anyone inside a mindscape is able to perceive and use a <i>mindscape door</i> within that mindscape. Anyone who enters is subject to all rules of the mindscape, but is aware she is in a mindscape if you informed her where the portal leads.  When you cast this spell inside a mindscape, a duplicate of the door appears next to your body in the real world. The creator of the mindscape can attempt a Will saving throw to prevent you  from creating the door if she is within the mindscape. The two doors operate as if you'd cast the spell outside a mindscape. You still designate who can use the door from the real world to get into the mindscape, but you can't prevent creatures within the mindscape from exiting to the real world.  Typically, a <i>mindscape door</i> operates in both directions, but you can create it as a one-way door if you so choose. Unlike with other spells, you can cast this spell as a full-round action while engaged in a psychic duel. This spell can be used to exit a binary mindscape, but not to enter one. If you successfully cast <i>mindscape door</i> within a veiled mindscape, you learn that you are in a mindscape, but other creatures observing the door don't automatically realize they are.</p></h4></div>"},

The target creature must be within spell range and you must know where it is, though you do not need line of sight or line of effect to it. When you transfer your soul upon casting, your body appears to be dead. Failure to take over a host ends the spell.  If you are successful, your life force occupies the host body. The host's soul is imprisoned with you, but can still use its own senses (though it can't assert any influence or use even purely mental abilities). You can communicate telepathically with the host as if you shared a common language, but only with your consent. You keep your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. The body retains its Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, hit points, natural abilities, and automatic abilities. A body with extra limbs doesn't allow you to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. You can't activate the body's extraordinary or supernatural abilities, nor can you cast any of its spells or spell-like abilities.  As a standard action, you can shift freely back to your own body regardless of range, so long as it remains on the same plane. If the host's body is killed, you return to your own body and the life force of the host departs (it is dead). If your body is slain, when the spell expires or the host's body is killed, you are slain. It is possible to cast this spell on a new target from within another creature's body; this resets the duration. You still return to your original body (not any intermediate body) when you take a standard action to do so or the spell's duration expires. Returning to your body ends the spell.

You create a mental landscape that provides succor and calm for you, such as a library, sitting room, garden, or childhood tree house. You can spend up to 15 minutes in your <i>psychic asylum</i>. While you are within, no time passes for your body, and when you emerge you can continue with your turn. The mindscape is overt, finite, and has a rapid passage of time.  While within the mindscape, you can consult any text, recall any conversation, or remember any image that you have been exposed to with perfect clarity and recollection, as if you had an eidetic memory. You must have seen or heard the material within a time frame of 1 week per level. For example, you might wish to reexamine a passage of text from an ancient manuscript you rapidly scanned in a library 2 weeks prior. While in the <i>psychic asylum</i>, you can perfectly recall the precise layout of the text  within the ancient manuscript and read it word for word. Once you emerge from the <i>psychic asylum</i>, you can recall the details of what you had just studied as clearly as if you had just looked at it, but you no longer have total recall of the material.  If you're able to prepare spells, you can use the time to prepare a single spell. For example, if you were poisoned, you could use your swift action to cast <i>psychic asylum</i>, pray and meditate for the full 15 minutes to gain <i>neutralize poison</i>, then emerge from the mindscape and immediately cast the spell upon yourself as your standard action.  Any mind-affecting spell that was affecting you before you cast the spell continues to expend its duration on you while you are within the <i>psychic asylum</i>, so you can use this spell to wait out the effects of such a condition.

No spell or ability short of <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> can locate or affect the item  while it is under the effect of this spell. Though the item seems to not exist while under the effects of this spell, its own reality is consistent (it ages normally, and any ongoing effects upon it continue normally). The target object can be one size larger than Tiny for every 5 caster levels above 5th you possess.  The target item returns to existence when the spell's duration expires. An item returns to existence in exactly the same location and condition it left. If the location no longer has room for the item, the item takes 1d0 points of damage (bypassing hardness) and is teleported to the nearest location that has room for it. If that location is more than 5 feet from the original location, there is a 25% chance the item is instead shifted to a randomly determined alternate plane.</p></h4></div>"},

This spell is similar to <i>animal messenger</i>, but can affect larger animals. In addition, the target animal is temporarily <i>awaken</i>ed to sentience (as the <i>awaken</i> spell) for the duration of this spell, and it can use its increased mental acuity to come up with creative solutions to overcome obstacles to delivering its message. The <i>awaken</i>ed target animal speaks any one language you know. In addition, you can imbue the animal with up to 5 ranks in any of the following skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Knowledge (local), Knowledge (nobility), Linguistics, or Sense Motive. It treats any of these skills that are class skills for you as class skills. The number of ranks you imbue in any of these skills can't exceed the target animal's Hit Dice nor the number of ranks you possess in that skill.  The message you send with your <i>animal ambassador</i> can be a verbal message, which the <i>awaken</i>ed target animal can speak using its own voice or deliver using your voice. It can engage in conversation using its own intellect, knowledge, and linguistic abilities. The <i>animal ambassador</i> is loyal to you, but it is otherwise susceptible to mind-affecting effects like any other creature. You can also send your <i>animal ambassador</i> with an object or container that is within its physical ability to carry, making it deliver the contents to the target of your intended message. If the object it is given to carry is poisonous, trapped, or otherwise inherently dangerous (even if it would normally be dangerous only to the creature receiving it rather than the animal), or if you or your allies attack the target animal, the <i>animal ambassador</i> spell fails and the animal becomes hostile toward you. The <i>animal ambassador</i> intelligently but single-mindedly attempts to deliver the message to its intended target, and you can't task it with other tasks like fighting, scouting, searching for traps, and so on. It leaves on its delivery once it receives its message.  Once the <i>animal ambassador</i> has located its target and delivered its message (and object, if desired), its enhanced mental abilities fade within 2d6 minutes.

Finally, you are able to locate and analyze the signature flourishes in a magical aura that allow you to match a spell to the person who cast it.

If a fellow worshiper is outside your line of sight, then you discern his direction but not his exact location.  Each round, you can rotate to detect worshipers in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but a sheet of lead, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. A creature's personal interpretation of its beliefs determines whether or not it is of the same faith as you-hence heretics and splinter cultists of your deity still count as worshipers of that deity. Furthermore, since the spell picks up a creature's current beliefs and feelings, a creature actively pretending to be a member of the same faith also appears to the spell to be a member. Thus, the spell is still useful in locating potential hidden members of the same faith among the general populace, but on its own, it doesn't weed out spies.</p></h4></div>"},

You could, for example, make stab wounds close up as though they were never there, rearrange bruises on the neck, evaporate traces of poison within the body into nothingness, make burn marks grow to cover the corpse's skin, or shrivel the target's body  as though the creature had starved. This spell can't hide extreme alterations to the body (such as the loss of a limb), nor can it restore flesh to a skeletal corpse or strip a corpse down to skeletal form. It is also unable to change the apparent identity of the corpse.  Anyone who closely examines the corpse can attempt a Perception check (DC = 10 + your caster level) to notice that the corpse's wounds (or lack thereof) don't look natural, but this doesn't allow the observer to determine what the corpse looked like before this spell was cast.

A high result doesn't allow you to break the HD maximum for the spell, and a result of 20 or less means you can't call a fey at all.

The target gains the same bonuses and penalties on its Will save to resist this spell as the bonuses and penalties that apply to the <i>scrying</i> spell (including a +5 bonus if the target is on another plane).  The illusion created by the spell moves with the target, and is not stationary. The image can affect the way the target is perceived, the way the target's surroundings are perceived, and the way that specific creatures or objects around the target are perceived. For the target, and any other specific creatures or objects you specify, you can cause them to appear as other creatures or objects that you designate, not to appear at all, or to have their appearance unaltered. For the target's surroundings, you can choose to make the target appear to be somewhere else, either a specific location with which you are familiar, or a generic location conjured from your imagination. You can change the way that the spell affects the appearance of any of these things by concentrating on the spell. You can also cause creatures or objects to appear in the illusion that are not really there, or to make a creature or object seem to act in a way other than it is actually acting. In this case, you must concentrate on the spell, or these aspects of the illusion simply remain static. The spell can provide visual, auditory, olfactory, tactile, and thermal sensations as needed.

When they are in your presence, the insects obey your mental commands, and you can issue orders to any number of them as a single standard action, provided that you issue the same orders to each one. In order to issue different orders to different insects, you must spend a separate standard action for each set of orders. An insect in physical contact with you can answer simple questions about what it has observed, at a rate of one question per round. It can relate only what it perceived with its senses, and can't repeat speech. It has difficulty making subjective judgments, and questions that demand such reasoning are unlikely to yield a clear answer. For example, an insect is unable to relay someone's emotional state or determine who among several people it saw might be in charge.  Each insects' size is Fine. Each insect has 1 hit point, AC 20 (+2 Dexterity, +8 size), a movement speed of 5 feet, a climb speed of 5 feet, and a fly speed of 20 feet (perfect maneuverability). The insects use your saving throw bonuses, have a total Perception skill bonus equal to 5 + 1/2 your caster level, and can't make attacks. Due to their incredibly small size and magical nature, they can make Stealth checks to avoid being noticed even if they lack a source of cover or concealment, and they have a total Stealth skill bonus equal to 18 + 1/2 your caster level. The insects can even climb onto creatures of Tiny or larger size while using Stealth, possibly riding on those creatures unnoticed. A Tiny creature gains a +16 bonus on Perception checks made to notice one of these insects currently climbing on it. For each size category larger than Tiny the creature being climbed is, this bonus is reduced by 4 (to a minimum of +0 for Huge or larger creatures).  You also maintain a faint mystical connection with these insects, which allows you to sense where they are. As a full-round action, you can concentrate on the spell in order to learn the direction and relative distance of each of the insects.</p></h4></div>"},

If a poison is affected by an additional effect that requires a caster level check to detect the poison or increases the DC to identify it-such as <i>obscure poison</i> (see page 220)-those effects don't stack.

The criteria must be something objective and observable. For example, you could cause the mage's decree to reach only creatures of a certain race. You can't choose recipients that rely on unobservable information, such as creatures of a certain alignment or of a particular class.  You can't pick and choose individual creatures to target or exclude. While the spell's range defaults to 1 mile per caster level, you can choose to reduce it to a smaller radius, although the spell's area can't be shaped.  The nature of the spell prevents the message it carries from having any magical power; the message can't be used to transmit spells or abilities that are conveyed via speech. The message is transmitted in your voice in whatever language you use to speak it, and is not automatically translated. Any steps you take to disguise your voice are just as effective for messages delivered via this spell as they are for your normal speech.

You can imagine a purpose for each room of the mansion, and the proper accouterments appear within. Any furniture or other mundane fixtures function normally for anyone inside the mansion, but cease to exist if taken beyond its walls. No fixture created with this spell can create magical effects, but magical devices brought into the mansion function normally.  A <i>resplendent mansion</i> contains the same types of foodstuffs and servants as a mage's magnificent mansion.  Each of the mansion's exterior doorways and windows are protected by <i>alarm</i> spells. You choose whether each <i>alarm</i> is audible or mental as you cast the spell, and each <i>alarm</i> has a different sound (for an audible <i>alarm</i>) or sensation (for a mental one), allowing you to instantly determine which portal has been used.  The mansion must be created on a plot of land free of other structures. It adapts to the natural terrain, adopting all structural requirements for being built on, for example, a mountainside. The mansion adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock, but can't be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If created on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid surface underneath, the foundation reaches the solid ground. If created on a solid but unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, there's a 10% chance each day that the mansion begins to sink or collapse.

You can choose to follow the rumor by selecting any such creature in range, at which point the creatures who heard the rumor from you no longer glow silver, and now the creatures who heard the rumor from your chosen creature glow silver instead.

The glow identifies only creatures who heard the same information you conveyed.

You can instead use this spell to trace a rumor back to its source once you hear it. In this case, you repeat the rumor as you heard it for the spell's verbal component.

This process continues each time you locate the next individual spreading the same information. Each individual attempts the save until one of them succeeds (in which case the spell ends and you can't attempt to trace this particular rumor again) or you trace the rumor to its original source.

Each round it removes an item as determined randomly from the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands, head, headband, shoulders, or wrists. When determining randomly, don't include any slots if the character has no item of that sort, and don't include items that take more than one move action to remove. Though creatures can't have more than one magic item in any of those slots, they can have multiple mundane items that fit each slot, in which case randomly decide which one they remove. If a target is wearing clothing that doesn't fit in any of those slots, such as breeches or a quiver, add it to the list of possibilities at the GM's discretion.  The target regards the discarded items with revulsion, and if forced to touch such an item (such as with a melee or ranged touch attack using the item as an improvised weapon), the target becomes sickened for 1d3 rounds. Other than the move action to remove items, the character can take whatever actions it chooses.</p></h4></div>"},

The spell can absorb up to 1 dose of poison per 3 caster levels, after which the gland is unable to process any more poison, and any further doses of ingested poison affect you normally.  You store each dose of absorbed poison within the gland, and you can end the spell to spray one dose of absorbed poison out of your mouth as a standard action.

The target corpse must be fresh-either dead for no more than 24 hours or appropriately preserved by an effect such as <i>gentle repose</i>. While casting the spell, you must remain in contact with the corpse while touching the living target with the focus item. As the spell is cast, the dead body's flesh unravels like ribbons to sheathe the living target, who must be within one size category of the corpse. While the spell is in effect, the focus item must remain within 30 feet of the target living creature.  The living target gains the physical appearance and size of the corpse, and gains its abilities as defined in <i>alter self</i> as well as any immunities, weapon proficiencies, weaknesses, and spell resistance the dead target had while living. The living target gains a +20 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to impersonate the individual whose corpse is targeted by this spell. The disguise created by <i>recorporeal incarnation</i> lasts for a number of weeks equal to your caster level, or until the focus item is moved more than 30 feet away from the living target. When the effect ends, the living target returns to its normal form, sloughing off the corpse's flesh.  The greatest strength of <i>recorporeal incarnation</i> is the difficulty of detecting it as a disguise. If subjected to <i>detect magic</i>, the living target sheds no magical aura, though the focus item gives off an aura of strong necromantic magic. <i>True seeing</i> does not reveal the living target's true form, since the corpse's flesh magically obscures it. The spell <i>detect undead</i> and similar effects indicate the living target is an undead creature, but the target is not truly undead, and is not affected by any other effects that target undead creatures. <i>Recorporeal incarnation</i> does not disguise the target's alignment.  If the living target of <i>recorporeal incarnation</i> dies while the spell is in effect, the spell continues. Any <i>raise dead</i> or similar spell cast upon that target resurrects that target, not the corpse flesh. Since <i>recorporeal incarnation</i> destroys the majority of the target corpse's physical remains, the target corpse cannot be restored to life except by <i>miracle</i>, <i>resurrection</i>, true <i>resurrection</i>, or <i>wish</i>.  <i>Recorporeal incarnation</i> can be made permanent by a 15th-level caster using <i>permanency</i> with a material component worth 17,500 gp.</p></h4></div>"},

If the target fails its saving throw, it cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities for the duration of the spell. Divine spellcasters whose power derives from the worship of a single deity (most clerics, paladins, and warpriests) have the potential to suffer worse. When targeting a divine spellcaster, you can designate an alignment. If the named alignment coincides with either the spellcaster's alignment or that of her deity, the divine spellcaster loses access to all supernatural and spell-like class abilities granted by the associated class for the spell's duration-blessings, domain powers, channel energy, smite evil, etc.  Those affected by this spell can end the effect early by choosing to release the blasphemies in a litany of screamed curses and heretical decadences. The creature is effectively paralyzed for half the spell's duration, and each ally within 50 feet must succeed at a Will saving throw (equal to this spell's save DC) or be shaken until the litany ends. If the creature chooses to do this, it cannot end the litany of blasphemies early. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw to avoid being shaken by its ally's blasphemous litany is immune to the litany's effects and need not attempt additional saves on subsequent rounds.</p></h4></div>"},

The area within a 50-foot radius of where the devil appears is ringed with a smoldering, red glow. This area is the testing ground. No creature other than the devil's challenger (see below) can be within this area while the spell is being cast.  On the round it appears, the devil identifies itself (typically by name and with a brief recitation of honors) and states it is prepared to do battle with a sole mortal champion. In the same round, either you or a creature you designate while casting the spell must identify the devil's challenger. For the duration of the spell, the devil does everything in its power to kill the challenger. You do not control the devil or have any influence over how it conducts itself in battle, but the devil cannot leave  the testing ground. Unlike with <i>summon monster</i> and similar spells, you cannot dismiss the devil. Rather, the summoned devil remains until any one of the following criteria is met: it is slain, its challenger is slain, its challenger leaves the testing ground, or it takes damage from any source other than its challenger. Upon any of these occurrences, the devil vanishes.  Summoning a devil is typically an evil act.

When you cast this spell, you can choose whether the restraints are manacles or fetters (see page 15). You also summon the restraints' key to your person, and the Disable Device DC to open the locked restraints is equal to 15 + your caster level + the modifier of your primary casting statistic. Typically, the restraints appear in your hands. However, as part of the spell's casting, you can attempt a melee touch attack against a creature; if you succeed and the creature then fails a Reflex saving throw, locked fetters appear clasped on the creature or locked manacles clasp you and the creature together. You can instead choose to have manacles restrain the target's limbs in front of or behind it.  If you cast the spell as a full-round action, you can make melee touch attacks against two creatures you can reach. If you succeed at both and both creatures fail their Reflex saving throws, you can have a set of manacles bind the targets together.  As you increase in level, the restraints become stronger and you gain more control over them.  If you are 6th level or higher, you can make the restraints mithral, or you can summon Tiny or Huge restraints.  If you are 12th level or higher, you can summon Diminutive or Huge restraints. If you use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while  casting this spell, as a standard action once during its duration, you can affect any creature bound by these restraints as per <i>dimensional anchor</i>, and the effect lasts 1 minute per caster level you have.  If you are 18th level or higher and use an emerald worth at least 1,000 gp as a material component while casting this spell, the restraints' hardness increases to 30, they have 60 hit points, and they can't be broken with a successful Strength check. (The emerald must be worth at least 2,000 gp if you also wish to use the <i>dimensional anchor</i> effect described earlier.)  If you cast this spell before the duration of a previous casting as lapsed, you can create a new set of restraints or reset the previous spell's duration. If you used an expensive material component during a previous casting, you must again use an expensive component when creating new restraints or resetting the duration if you wish to again use a special effect. You do not need to touch these previously created shackles to renew their duration, though you must be on the same plane as the shackles.

This spell has two purposes, and you choose which application to use at the time of casting.  <i>Combat Corruption</i>: Each time a creature fails a saving throw to prevent its corruption from progressing (as described in that  corruption's Progression section), it advances to the next corruption stage-at stage 3, it loses the battle against its corruption. Using this spell can lower the target's corruption stage by 1. This has no effect if the target isn't at progression stage of 1 or higher.  <i>Remove Corruption</i>: You can remove 1 manifestation level from the target creature, as well as the most recently acquired manifestation and its corresponding gift and stain. Doing this also reduces the power of gifts and stains that vary based upon manifestation level. This application of <i>alleviate corruption</i> doesn't reduce the target's corruption stage. If the target creature loses all manifestation levels, it is cured of the corruption.  Either application of the spell requires a caster level check. The DC is equal to 10 + double the target's manifestation level + 3 times the target's corruption stage (effectively 0, 3, or 6, since stage 3 removes the character from player control).  Tampering with corruptions is dangerous, as their nature is contagious. If you fail this caster level check by 5 or more, you contract the corruption and gain a manifestation (the rules for the useful and vile corruption variants still apply). A roll of natural 1 on the caster level check is an automatic failure. If you already have the same corruption, you must instead attempt an immediate saving throw against it. Casting <i>alleviate corruption</i> on yourself automatically fails, as does casting it on a target who has fully succumbed to a corruption (failed three saving throws against it).

When you create the illusion, you choose the races, genders, and attire for the undead creatures. Additionally, the illusion makes the undead creatures' movements appear lifelike (two shuffling zombies could be made to appear as two strolling lovers). The illusion doesn't create smell, sound, texture, or temperature. Undead with Intelligence scores can attempt a saving throw to negate the effect of the spell, but mindless undead do not. Any creatures interacting with the illusion receive a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion.  The illusion interferes with <i>detect undead</i>, requiring the caster to succeed at a caster check (DC = 11 + your caster level) for the spell to determine the creatures are undead.  <i>Appearance of life</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 12th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.</p></h4></div>"},

This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. A successful saving throw halves the damage and negates the movement.  An undead creature takes no damage. Instead, you manipulate the undead, forcing it to take an immediate action to either move up to its speed (provoking attacks of opportunity as normal) or make a single attack against a creature of your choice in its reach. Either of these is the most basic version of the action the creature can take (it doesn't activate any special abilities that it could apply to the movement or attack, such as grab).

The room itself is covered in a layer of slippery, semi-real gore. Any creature attempting to walk within or through the area of gore can move at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check.

You take 1d4 points of Wisdom drain when you begin the speech and can't reduce or prevent this damage in any way. Each intelligent creature in the spell's area takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage as their perceptions of reality realign with yours for the spell's duration. Listeners with at least 5 HD can attempt a Will save to negate the effects. Your targets view you with a friendly attitude and respond to criticism of you with irritation. Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks to create doubt about your purpose in those affected by the spell take a -4 penalty. The attitude of your targets regarding any creature that criticizes you or your vision automatically changes one step toward hostile; a Diplomacy check that fails by 5 or more reduces their attitude further. Your targets retain the same alignment and their prior beliefs, in addition to the ones you force on them. You can't force  beliefs on a target if such beliefs would be necessarily against the nature of its alignment and prior beliefs, but targets are otherwise able to hold contradictory beliefs.

Only <i>greater restoration</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> can remove this decrease. A single casting of <i>greater restoration</i> removes one decrease in sanity from casting <i>compelling rant</i>, while a casting of <i>miracle</i> or <i>wish</i> removes them all. Affected targets take sanity damage equal to half your caster level (maximum 10) instead of Wisdom damage.

This spell can't contact creatures with more than 6 Hit Dice. You can't send a specific message, but this spell (and all similar <i>contact entity</i> spells) can be characterized as an open invitation to make contact and establish communication. If there is an appropriate entity within range, the spell succeeds automatically. You don't know whether the message was received, nor any specific details about what creatures received it or how many. Creatures that receive the message know the location and distance from where the spell was cast. Because this spell doesn't  call or summon the target, the target must have its own way to reach the place where the spell was cast.  How creatures respond to a contact spell is circumstantial and it is possible the creatures will simply ignore the spell. Creatures that come and investigate do so in their own time. They usually arrive cautiously, aware of the potential for ambush. Targets of the spell might inform their organization or community if they have one. There are no restrictions on how the creatures react to being contacted, and they might respond with hostility, parley, entertain an alliance, or subjugate the caster and their related community. Using this spell counts as mentally contacting the creature for the purpose of any of its special abilities (such as the star-spawn's overwhelming mind). For the purpose of spells like <i>scrying</i>, the creature has firsthand knowledge of you and a connection similar to if it possessed a likeness of you.  Each type of creature requires a different material component that must be included when casting the spell, as shown on Table 4-1: Contact Entity on page 112. Some of these components are expensive or might require quests to acquire. Contacting certain types of creatures makes the spell chaotic, evil, or both, as indicated on the table.</p></h4></div>"},

It rises as a zombie (<i>Pathfinder RPG Bestiary</i> 288) that is magically tethered to you and obeys your commands. As noted in <i>animate dead</i>, you can't control more than 4 HD per caster level worth of undead in total, nor can a single casting create more than 2 HD per caster level.  This spell disguises the zombie's appearance and allows you to control it. The zombie's outward appearance, movement, and voice appear the same as if it were still alive. The zombie's normal staggered condition doesn't apply (though it can still be staggered by other means). Successfully detecting the <i>flesh puppet</i> as a zombie without magic requires an opposed Perception check against your Disguise check, and you add your caster level as a bonus on this Disguise check.  An ephemeral string connects you to the zombie. Through this string, you have a mental link to the zombie and can command it as a swift action. The zombie uses its own actions to complete your commands. The zombie can speak up to 25 words in 1 round, but you must mentally impart what you intend it to say as a swift action. It is incapable of articulating speech on its own. The zombie can be ordered to perform very simple tasks it knew in life but can't make attacks, cast spells, or perform complex or difficult tasks requiring constant concentration.  The string connecting you and the zombie is nearly invisible. A DC 30 Perception check is required to detect it. It has hardness 0 and 1 hp. The length of string you can create is 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level you have. The string snaps if you and the zombie move farther apart than this length, though the zombie won't move out of range unless forced to do so or unless you command it to do so. If the string to the zombie is severed, the spell immediately ends. The ephemeral string can pass through  physical barriers, but not barriers of magical force, and it can be damaged as though it were a physical object.  When this spell ends, the zombie immediately reverts back to a normal corpse. The spell ends automatically if you cast <i>flesh puppet</i> or <i>flesh puppet</i> horde on a new corpse.</p></h4></div>"},

A separate string attaches to each zombie in your horde. Severing a zombie's string reverts that zombie to a corpse, but doesn't end the spell for other zombies. Because commanding a <i>flesh puppet</i> requires a swift action, you can issue commands to only one zombie per round, though zombies you previously commanded continue to follow their orders. Likewise, you can command only one zombie to speak per round.  Unlike with <i>flesh puppet</i>, you can command a zombie to attack. If you do, all your zombies immediately gain the staggered quality and no longer appear to be alive.

The wall inserts itself into any surrounding nonliving material if its area is sufficient to do so. The wall can't be created so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. The wall must be vertical, but can be shaped as you see fit.  The wall is considered to be undead. It uses your Will saving throw to resist channel energy.  A <i>flesh wall</i> is 2 feet thick. Each 5-foot square of the wall has 12 hit points and DR 5/slashing. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. As a move action, you can cause the fleshwall to constrict, shrinking it by a 5-foot square to fill the hole. Additionally, as a standard action, you can cause a 5-foot square of  the wall to permanently detach, forming a human zombie (<i>Bestiary</i> 288) under your verbal control (this zombie doesn't count against your normal limit of commanded undead). The zombie reverts back into a normal corpse when the spell's effect ends. Each 5-foot square of the wall makes a single slam attack against an adjacent enemy on your turn, as a human zombie. The squares of the wall threaten their adjacent squares and can even provide flanking.  Creatures can force their way slowly through the wall by making a Strength check as a full-round action. The DC to move through the wall is equal to 15 + your caster level. A creature that fails the check is trapped in the wall, takes 3d6 points of crushing damage, and is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC against the wall's slam attack. The creature can make an attempt to escape the wall on its next turn.  You can use zombies already under your control as the material components for a <i>flesh wall</i>.

You must succeed at a melee touch attack to infect the target. If the target succeeds at its Fortitude saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution) and the spell ends. If the target fails its saving throw, it takes 1d4 points of ability damage to each physical ability score immediately and continues to take 1d4 points of ability damage to each of its physical ability scores every day, until the spell expires. It can't recover this ability damage as long as the spell lasts, even with magic. While the spell continues, the target takes on physical plant characteristics as appropriate to the environment. It begins to diminish in height and its skin turns plantlike. For example, the target's skin might turn <i>green</i> and its hair is slowly replaced with grass or leaves or the target's skin might become smooth, pale, and flabby as the creature transforms into a large mushroom in an underground environment.  If the damage to any single ability score equals or exceeds that score, the target fully transforms into a normal small tree or shrub. This final transformation is instantaneous, ending <i><i>green</i> caress</i>. The target remains alive but is considered the same as a regular tree, shrub, or other vegetation. Any ability damage from other sources, like poison or disease, also applies toward transforming the creature. If the target retains at least 1 point in all of its physical ability scores at the end of 7 days, the final transformation doesn't occur and the spell ends. Any changes in appearance gradually reverse themselves as the ability damage heals.  <i>Break enchantment</i>, <i>dispel magic</i>, and <i>remove curse</i> can end the spell before the duration expires, but the spell is contagious. If a caster level check attempt to remove <i><i>green</i> caress</i> fails by 5 or more, the creature who attempted to remove the effect must attempt a Fortitude saving throw as if it had just been targeted with the spell. If the spell's target attempts to remove the effect from itself and fails, it causes the spell to behave as if affected by <i>plant growth</i> (as described below).  <i>Polymorph any object</i> ends the spell and totally restores the target without any risk to the caster, even after the target has been finally transformed, as do <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, <i>miracle</i>, and <i>wish</i> (treat <i>polymorph any object</i> as if it had an instantaneous duration if it is used in this way).

A creature affected by this spell doesn't recover from the fatigued or exhausted condition inflicted by this spell after resting, nor do spells such as <i>lesser restoration</i> provide any respite.

Targets of the spell perceive everyone else around them to be rotting away, but other creatures see no visible effect of the spell, so they, in addition to those who disbelieve, can communicate the nature of the illusion to allies, providing those allies with a +4 bonus on the saving throw to disbelieve.

When the sacrifice dies, its blood or ichor pools and hardens into a single red bloodstone. This bloodstone contains the essence and spirit of the sacrificed creature, allowing anyone holding the stone to activate the creature's highest-level activated racial spell-like ability, taking the actions necessary to activate the stored spell-like ability. Any creature who holds the stone can activate it, but the stone can be used only once per day (or the frequency of the creature's spell-like ability, whichever is less). If a creature has several racial spell-like abilities of the same spell level, choose randomly from among them to determine which one is stored in the bloodstone. The bloodstone can only store racial spell-like abilities that emulate a spell, including altered spells, like <i>invisibility</i> (self only), but not unique spell-like abilities possessed by the creature. Abilities with altered effects are still altered, so a creature activating the bloodstone for <i>greater teleport</i> (self only) would affect only itself and a bloodstone storing <i>summon monster II</i> (Small fire elemental only) would still only be able to summon a Small fire elemental. Additionally, the bloodstone can't store spell-like abilities that duplicate spells with expensive components costing more than 250 gp.  The save DC, caster level, and other attributes of this ability remain the same as when the creature was still alive, though the creature who activates the bloodstone can choose the targets, area, or shape of the spell, and make other decisions, such as  controlling the target of <i>dominate person</i>. The bloodstone can take any actions necessary to manipulate aspects of the spell, concentrating on the spell, redirecting the spell, and so on, up to a full normal round's worth of actions.  If the sacrificed creature doesn't die during the casting of the spell (for instance if it was merely a summoned creature) or is brought back to life before the spell's duration expires, the bloodstone loses its magical power.

While trapped in the object, the creature can't take any actions and is immune to spells and spell-like abilities. The creature remains permanently trapped in the object as long the object remains in your possession. Only a <i>freedom</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell can dispel the enchantment, though destroying the object frees the creature.  If you relinquish your stewardship of the object (such as giving it away or leaving it in a remote location or extradimensional space), the trapped creature begins to gain control over the object. It immediately gains the ability to communicate telepathically with any creature now in possession of the object. It still can't take any actions besides communicating but can use feats and skills related to speaking (such as Bluff and Diplomacy).  After 1 week of the object being out of your presence, the creature can create a number of haunts with a total CR (that is, the CR of the encounter with all of the haunts at once) equaling 1/4 the creature's Hit Dice. These haunts are centered on the object. The creature can also communicate telepathically up to a range of 100 feet at this point.  After 1 month of the object being out of your presence, the CR total of the haunts the trapped creature can create increases to 1/2 its Hit Dice. In addition to telepathy, it can also impart mental images of its choosing into the mind of any creature holding or carrying the object.  After 1 year of being out of your presence, in addition to the above abilities, the creature can attempt to possess any living  creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that touches the object, as per possessionOA. However, the creature can't personally destroy the object, even while possessing another creature.  Because the binding magic irrevocably weakens the longer you're away from the item, returning it to your ownership doesn't reverse any of the effects. You must free the creature and impose another <i>sacramental seal</i> if you want to restrict its abilities again.  If the object is placed in the stewardship of creatures or a location belonging to your faith, it still counts as being out of your presence but it takes ten times longer for the creature to manifest the above abilities (it would take 10 weeks for it to manifest the ability to create haunts, for example).</p></h4></div>"},

The spell takes effect immediately if the target is already asleep, or as soon as the target falls asleep if it is conscious. You can specify that the creature should wait before taking action when you give your instructions if you so choose. A sleeping creature doesn't get a save against this spell. The suggested activity must not cause the target to directly harm itself or others, but it doesn't need to be reasonable. For example, you could instruct the target to unlock doors and windows or poison its ally's rations, but not jump off a roof or perform a coup de grace action against a sleeping ally. Instructions that cause direct harm prompt the target to awaken just prior to performing the action and the target experiences a vague memory of what it was supposed to do.  The target moves at its speed, but isn't capable of running or moving at a higher rate of speed. It moves in dark conditions as if it had darkvision and can perform most simple and skill-based actions, but it can't engage in combat, spellcasting, or actions that require significant cognitive awareness (like making complex decisions, solving puzzles, or using complicated magic items). If the creature takes any damage while sleepwalking, it must attempt a new saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell ends and the creature awakens. When the target completes the suggested course of activity, or when the spell ends or is dismissed, the target remains unconscious and returns to where it was sleeping and must be awoken normally. It retains no memory of what it did while unconscious (with the only exception described above).  Unlike the sleepwalkAPG spell, attempts to use <i>sleepwalking suggestion</i> on a creature that is unconscious for any reason other than sleep automatically fail.

While a DC 15 Heal check or magical healing can end the bleed damage as normal, the bleed damage and sickened condition begin again each round so long as the creature begins its turn still within 60 feet of the symbol, including if the creature leaves the area and returns. Creatures that succeed at their saving throw suffer no ill effects from the symbol, even if they leave its area and return.  Unlike <i>symbol of death</i>, <i>symbol of exsanguination</i> has no hit point limit on the creatures it can affect. Once triggered, a <i>symbol of exsanguination</i> remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.  Magic traps such as <i>symbol of exsanguination</i> are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character who has the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it.

Each transformed dog has the same stats as a hell hound (<i>Bestiary</i> 173) except that it doesn't have fire immunity and cold vulnerability and instead has acid, cold, and fire resistance 5. Additionally, each transformed dog deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage with its bite attack (instead of fire damage), and its breath weapon is replaced with a vaporous cloud that spreads out in front of the creature in a 10-foot cone, dealing 2d4 points of acid damage.

The haunt remains within the object until a creature fails its save or the spell's duration ends.  Once a creature is affected by the haunt, it begins noticing a large, black mastiff with ominous green eyes watching and following it from a distance, always just beyond the range of focus or interaction. The grim stalker terrorizes the creature's sleep, affecting it as per <i>nightmare</i> every night during the spell's duration (Will negates for one night). Each time the creature takes hit point damage, the grim stalker lunges closer, causing the creature to become shaken for 1 round (Will negates).

Each time the grim stalker lunges at the affected creature, the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.

In the case of conflicting commands issued from different true worshipers of Hastur, the commanders must attempt opposed Charisma checks, with the winner being able to command the targets for that round.
