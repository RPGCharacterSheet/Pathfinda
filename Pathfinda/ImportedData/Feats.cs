No matter which skill you use, antagonizing a creature takes a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and has a DC equal to 10 + the target's Hit Dice + the target's Wisdom modifier. You cannot make this check against a creature that does not understand you or has an Intelligence score of 3 or lower. Before you make these checks, you may make a Sense Motive check (DC 20) as a swift action to gain an insight bonus on these Diplomacy; or Intimitade checks equal to your Charisma bonus until the end of your next turn. The benefits you gain for this check depend on the skill you use. This is a mind-affecting effect.  <br><i>Diplomacy</i>: You fluster your enemy. For the next minute, the target takes a -2 penalty on all attacks rolls made against creatures other than you and has a 10% spell failure chance on all spells that do not target you or that have you within their area of effect.  <br><i>Intimidate</i>: The creature flies into a rage. On its next turn, the target must attempt to make a melee attack against you, make a ranged attack against you, target you with a spell, or include you in the area of a spell. The effect ends if the creature is prevented from attacking you or attempting to do so would harm it (for example, if you are on the other side of a chasm or a <i>wall of</i> fire). If it cannot attack you on its turn, you may make the check again as an immediate action to extend the effect for 1 round (but cannot extend it thereafter). The effect ends as soon as the creature melee  attacks you. Once you have targeted a creature with this ability, you cannot target it again for 1 day.</h5></div>"},

The damage is acid or fire, as determined by the spell's descriptor.

Any level-dependent effects use the character level of the creature that drinks the sanguine elixir, or your sorcerer level, whichever is lower.

This takes 1 hour and expends 1 use of your bomb ability for the day. When the implanted creature dies or is destroyed, the bomb detonates in the creature's square as if it were a delayed bomb set by you (though you can set the bomb's damage to less than your normal bomb damage). You can use any bomb-affecting discoveries on this implanted bomb (acid bomb, frost bomb, smoke bomb, and so on) as normal. The bomb automatically detonates 24 hours after you implant it in the creature.  If you expend 150 gp worth of alchemical reagents per die of the bomb's damage (for example, 750 gp for a 5d6 bomb), the bomb does not automatically detonate after 24 hours, and only detonates if the creature dies or is destroyed (24 hours after implantation, this bomb no longer counts toward your daily total).  Implanting a bomb is as invasive as using the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds and leaves surgical scars unless the creature is healed by magic or abilities such as regeneration or fast healing. Some creatures (such as oozes, elementals, and creatures with the incorporeal quality) cannot have bombs implanted in them. Removing an implanted bomb requires a Heal check to treat deadly wounds, followed by a <i>dispel magic</i> spell or Disable Device check to neutralize the bomb (DC = 11 + alchemist's caster level).</h5></div>"},

A thanatopic spell that would kill a living creature (such as by giving it negative levels equal to its Hit Dice) destroys an undead (though undead such as ghosts, liches, and vampires may reform as normal). Undead affected by thanatopic spells that give negative levels automatically make their saving throws to remove negative levels after 24 hours.

If the creature fails its check, it agrees to exchange your object for its own. Obvious differences in the value between the exchanged items give your roll a +4 or -4 modifier, at the GM's discretion (offering a clay cup for a jeweled dagger gives your roll a -4 penalty). The GM may rule that some items are too obviously valuable or worthless for this feat to apply (a king wouldn't trade his crown for any item, and no normal person would trade an item for a piece of garbage). If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target is insulted and his attitude toward you worsens by one category. Once the exchange happens, make an Appraise roll opposed by the target's Appraise or Sense Motive roll. If the target wins, it immediately realizes the true value of the object you offered it and behaves accordingly. If you succeed, it believes your false assessment for 1 round; for every 5 by which your check exceeds your opponent's check, the deception lasts 1 more round. As with disbelieving illusions, the target's ally can point out the true value of the object, giving the target another check with a +2 bonus.

The creature gains your vampire or dhampir weaknesses and fast healing 5. If you are a vampire, the creature also gains the following abilities, depending on what type of vampire you are.  <i>Jiang-Shi</i>: If the creature is adjacent to you or you are sharing a square, it gains the benefit of your prayer scroll ability. The creature crumbles into dust if destroyed ( just like a jiang-shi), but is not permanently destroyed unless measures are taken that would destroy a jiang-shi.  <i>Moroi</i>: If the creature is adjacent to or in your square when you assume <i>gaseous form</i>, it transforms with you and follows you; its transformation ends when yours does. If reduced to 0 hit points, it is forced into <i>gaseous form</i> and must return to your coffin to reform (or the foot of your coffin if it cannot fit within it).  <i>Nosferatu</i>: If the creature is adjacent to or in your square when you assume swarm form, it transforms with you and follows you; its transformation ends when yours does. The creature can climb as if using <i>spider climb</i>, even if its anatomy is not suitable for climbing (such as a horse).  <i>Vetala</i>: The creature may use malevolence and possession as if it were a vetala, but by touch and only affecting creatures or corpses that are the same type of creature as the animal companion or familiar (such as bear, horse, or snake). If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, the creature is helpless and its fast healing ceases to function for 1 hour (additional damage or desecration has no effect); after 1 hour it regains 1 hit point and is no longer helpless, and its fast healing resumes.

You may create a prayer scroll with this ability by using any strip of parchment and a writing instrument, but doing so requires 10 minutes of uninterrupted work. Swapping your current prayer scroll for a different prepared one is a standard action. When wearing a different prayer scroll, you gain its special abilities, but lose your normal prayer scroll's immunity to spell completion and spell trigger magic items. Your prayer scrolls can be used only by you, and have no effect when used by other jiang-shis. When you choose this feat, select one of the following prayer scroll types.  <br><i>Embalmed Form</i>: This prayer scroll alters your physical form to how you looked 1 day before your death. Treat this as an <i>alter self</i> spell that affects you regardless of your original or current type; your caster level is equal to your Hit Dice. Your speed increases by 10 feet, but you lose your immunity to trip attacks and your ability to move through difficult terrain unhindered. These effects persist indefinitely as long as you wear the prayer scroll, but end immediately if you use a different prayer scroll or 24 hours after you remove this prayer scroll.  <br><i>Enduring Dust</i>: If you crumble into dust from hit point damage, you reform after 1 round instead of 1 minute. Scattering your dust does not prevent you from reforming as long none of your dust is more than 30 feet from any other part of your dust. Storing a portion of your dust in an air-tight container prevents you from reforming. If you are unable to reform after 1 minute, you are destroyed.  <br><i>Positive Energy Immunity</i>: You become immune to positive channeled energy used to harm undead. This does not protect you against positive energy from other sources such as cure spells or lay on hands.  <br><i>Spell Immunity</i>: The prayer scroll grants you immunity to a spell, as if you were using <i>spell immunity</i>. You decide which spell when you create the prayer scroll, and can choose a different spell each time you create a new <i>spell immunity</i> prayer scroll. If you have 15 or more Hit Dice, this functions as greater <i>spell immunity</i>.

The illusion must be one you retain ongoing control of, such as <i>minor image</i>, and the target must be both visible to you and within or adjacent to the area of your illusion. Using this feat immediately ends the figment's duration. You must either make a melee touch attack or give the target a saving throw (Fortitude or Reflex) to resist the damage (see below). If you choose a melee touch attack, you use your own melee touch attack bonus, and if you miss, the spell deals no damage. If you choose to allow the target a saving throw, a successful save means it takes half damage. The shadowy attack deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level. If the target disbelieves or sees through the illusion, reduce the damage by half. The shadowy attack can deal acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, or slashing damage, but the damage must be appropriate to the illusion. For example, an illusory wall that collapses deals bludgeoning damage with a Fortitude save for half, an illusory swordsman strikes with a melee touch attack deals slashing damage, and an illusory wall of fire deals fire damage with a Reflex save for half.</h5></div>"},

If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the entangle effect. If the spell does not normally allow a save, a creature can make a Reflex save (DC = the spell's DC if it had a saving throw) to negate the effect. If the spell allows spell resistance, failing to overcome a creature's spell resistance means it is not entangled. An entangled creature remains so as long as it is in the area of the spell and for 1 round after it leaves. A creature that leaves and reenters the area must make a new saving throw to avoid becoming entangled. Creatures that succeed at a save to resist being entangled do not have to make additional saves if they stay within the darkened area. You are never impeded by the effects of your spells modified by this feat. A Shadow Grasp spell uses up a slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.</h5></div>"},

Any attempts at dispelling a tenebrous spell in darkness or dim light take a -2 penalty on the dispel check. Casting a tenebrous spell in bright light is difficult, and requires a concentration check (DC 15 + twice the tenebrous spell's effective spell level). Attempts to dispel a tenebrous spell in bright light gain a +4 bonus on the dispel check. You cannot use this feat on spells with the light descriptor. A tenebrous spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level, except in the case of spells with the darkness or shadow descriptor or of the illusion (shadow) subschool; this feat does not change the effective level of those spells (but still counts as using a metamagic feat for all other purposes).</h5></div>"},

As long as the spell is in effect, the creature or object affected radiates darkness in a 10-foot radius, reducing illumination similar to the effects of the <i>darkness</i> spell. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches or lanterns, do not increase the light level in this area. Magical light sources only increase the light level in an area affected by an umbral spell if they are of a higher level than the umbral spell's unmodified spell level. This effect does not stack with itself or with any other effect that creates darkness. An umbral spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level. You cannot use this feat on a spell with an instantaneous duration or a spell that does not target a creature or object.</h5></div>"},

Both you and the recipient of the tattoo (if the recipient is not yourself) must be present during the entire tattooing process. Magic tattoos must be placed on a part of the body normally able to hold a magic item slot, but they do not count against or interfere with magic items worn on those slots. A single slot can only hold one magical tattoo (nonmagical tattoos and tattoos acquired from the tattooed sorcerer archetype do not count against this limit). Tattoos may be inscribed on the following slots: belt, body, chest, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, ring (up to two), or wrist. They cannot be inscribed on armor, eye, headband, or shield slots. Magical tattoos are difficult to destroy, though they count as magic items for the purposes of <i>dispel magic</i>. The spell <i>erase</i> can permanently destroy a magical tattoo, but the bearer of the tattoo can resist the spell with a Will save, in addition to the caster needing to make a successful caster level check to <i>erase</i> the tattoo. Physically removing a magical tattoo with a sharp instrument or defacing it with fire or acid can destroy it as well. Doing so is a full-round action that not only requires the target to be willing or helpless, but also provokes attacks of opportunity. At least 2 points of damage per caster level of the tattoo must be dealt to destroy a magical tattoo in this manner. Magical tattoos follow the rules for magic item creation as though they were wondrous items, except that they can use the Craft (calligraphy, paintings, tattoos) skill. New magical tattoos can be researched and designed using the guidelines for pricing new magic items. Magical tattoos are treated as slotless magical items for pricing purposes.</h5></div>"},

For example, a cleric must have Alignment Channel (good) to bless a weapon with the <i>holy</i> special ability, Alignment Channel (law) to bless a shield with the <i>vigilant</i> special ability, and so on.

To bless a piece of equipment with a particular blessing, you must expend a number of uses of channel energy equal to the number listed in the table above, and your caster level must be equal to or greater than that listed for the selected blessing. This blessing lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice you are capable of dealing or healing with your channel energy ability (for example, the blessing of a cleric capable of channeling 3d6 points of damage would last for 3 rounds), during which time the item is treated as though it possessed the selected special ability. If the piece of equipment belongs to an unwilling creature, that creature may attempt a Will save to prevent the blessing, as if attempting a saving throw against your channel energy ability (so bonuses from channel resistance and similar effects apply); if the creature succeeds at its save, the channeled energy is expended to no effect. Only magical and masterwork weapons, armor, and shields may be blessed with this feat. When you bless a masterwork item, you must expend one additional use of your channel energy ability beyond those normally expended to grant the selected blessing. In addition to the selected blessing, the masterwork item gains a temporary +1 enhancement bonus for the blessing's duration. You can grant a piece of equipment only one blessing at a time.

You can also bless a piece of equipment with up to two blessings at a time. Each blessing provides a different special ability drawn from the Bless Equipment list (and the Align Equipment list if you possess that feat). You must still have a high enough caster level to bless a piece of equipment with each of the selected blessings. You expend the appropriate number of uses of channeled energy required for each blessing, taking into account the reduction granted by this feat (and the increase for blessing a masterwork item, if needed). For example, a cleric with this feat would need to expend two uses of channeled energy to bless a weapon with the <i>undead-<i>bane</i></i> and <i><i>ghost</i> touch</i> special abilities (one use for <i>bane</i> plus one use for <i><i>ghost</i> touch</i>). If a given piece of equipment already has a blessing on it, you can give it a second blessing. When another blessing is applied to a piece of equipment that currently has a blessing active on it, the durations for the two blessings are tracked separately.</h5></div>"},

To use holy water in a particular way, you must meet the additional requirements of that effect, such as a particular feat, ranks in a specific skill, or the ability to cast a certain spell (specified after the effect's name). Unless otherwise specified, using any of these abilities consumes one vial of holy water. <i>Blinding Water</i> (Improved Precise Shot): By uttering a short prayer as swift action, you can empower a vial of holy water with blinding light. If you successfully throw that vial of holy water and land a direct hit against an undead creature by the end of your next turn, the target takes damage from the holy water as normal and also becomes blinded (Ref lex DC 13 negates blindness). This even affects creatures that do not have eyes such as skeletons, but not creatures that don't rely on vision. <i>Concentrate Holy Water</i> (Craft [alchemy] 4 ranks): Through alchemical processes, you can refine multiple doses of holy water into a single hyperpotent dose. To do so, you must possess two or more flasks of holy water and you must succeed at a Craft (alchemy) check that takes 10 minutes of uninterrupted time. The DC of the Craft (alchemy) check is equal to 15 + 2 x the number of doses of holy water you are combining. For example, combining three flasks of holy water would require a successful DC 21 Craft (alchemy) check. Success means you combine all of the doses into a single concentrated flask of holy water. If you fail the check by 4 or less, the distillation process failed and must be tried again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the distillation process failed and all of the doses of holy water are wasted. The maximum number of doses of holy water you can combine is equal to half the number of ranks you possess in Craft (alchemy). A direct hit with a flask of concentrated holy water deals 2d4 points of damage + 2 points of damage x the number of doses of holy water used to an undead creature or an evil outsider. Undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of where the flask hits take 1 point of damage + 1 point of damage x the number of doses of holy water used. For example, a flask of concentrated holy water made of 3 doses of holy water would deal 2d4+6 points of damage on a direct hit, and 4 points of damage to undead creatures and evil outsiders within 5 feet of the target. <i>Healing Glyph</i> (ability to cast <i>glyph of</i> warding): You can replace the diamond material component in a <i>glyph of</i> warding spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, you must place a <i>spell glyph</i> containing a conjuration (healing) spell of 3rd level or lower, which can be designed to benefit allies or harm undead. <i>Healing Water</i> (Heal 5 ranks): You can use holy water for curative purposes. When you pour a vial of holy water over your hands, you gain a +4 bonus on Heal checks to perform first aid, treat wounds, treat poison, or treat disease in the next hour. Additionally, once per day you can drink a vial of holy water to heal yourself of 1d8 points of damage. <i>Holy Circle</i> (ability to cast <i>magic circle against</i> evil): You can replace the silver material component of a <i>magic circle against</i> evil spell with a vial of holy water. When you do so, the duration of the spell increases 20 minutes per level instead of 10 minutes, and the Spellcraft DC to add a special diagram to the circle is 15 instead of 20. <i>Holy Water Splash</i> (Point-Blank Shot): When you throw a flask of holy water, creatures in the area of the holy water's splash radius take 1 additional point of damage as long as they are within 30 feet of you. This ability does not stack with other effects that increase the damage dealt to creatures within the splash radius of holy water, such as the concentrate holy water ability of this feat or the <i>empower holy water</i> spell on page 26.</h5></div>"},

Instead of the normal effects of successfully hitting with Channel Smite, you may choose the following effect. Starting on your target's next turn, it takes 1d8 points of damage each round at the beginning of its turn. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the number of damage dice you use to roll your channel energy ability. Your target can attempt a Will save each round, as if saving against your channeled energy, to negate the damage dealt to it by this feat on that round. If your initial attack misses, the use of channel energy is still expended with no effect.

You can apply this insight to empower your magical effects.<h5><b>Prerequisites: </b>Int 13, Spell Focus (divination), Spellcraft 3 ranks.</h5><h5><b>Benefit: </b>Immediately before casting a spell, as a swift action, you can attempt to augment a spell's casting using Arithmancy. To do so, determine the digital root of the name of the spell you are casting. To find the digital root of a spell name, first assign a numerical value to each letter of the name, per the Letter Values table. Once you have a string of digits, sum them. If the result has more than one digit, sum those digits. Repeat this process until you arrive at a single number, called the digital root. Once you've translated the name of the spell into a single digital root, attempt a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell level + the digital root. If your check succeeds, the spell is cast at +1 caster level. If your check fails, the spell is cast at -1 caster level. If you do not cast the spell you intended to augment with arithmancy, the spell is expended with no effect, though you retain the action you would have spent to cast it. Metamagic effects are not included in a spell's name when determining the spell's digital root, but they increase the spell's level as normal when determining the DC of the Spellcraft check. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to the number of caster levels you possess. For example, Ezren wants to use Arithmancy to cast an augmented <i>fireball</i>. First, he translates the spell name into numbers. <i>Fireball</i> translates to 6, 9, 9, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3. Then he calculates the digital root. In this case, 6 + 9 + 9 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 38, 3 + 8 = 11, and 1 + 1 = 2. Therefore, the digital root of <i>fireball</i> is 2. He then attempts a Spellcraft check against a DC of 15 (10 + 3 [<i>fireball</i>'s spell level] + 2 [<i>fireball</i>'s digital root]). If his check succeeds, he can cast the <i>fireball</i> this round at +1 caster level. If he fails, he can cast the spell at -1 caster level this round. He may also choose not to cast <i>fireball</i> and perform another action, though he expends the spell.</h5></div>"},

When casting a spell, you can perform the steps below to spontaneously apply the effects of either or both of these metamagic feats, as well as any other metamagic feats you have, to the spell without expending a higher-level spell slot. Using a feat in this way increases the spell's casting time to the casting time it would take if the character were a sorcerer or bard (sorcerers and bards using this ability increase the spell's casting time by two categories; see page 113 of the <i>Core</i> Rulebook); applying the Quicken Spell metamagic effect negates the increased casting time but still contributes to the modified spell's effective spell level. You can take this feat more than once; each time, select two additional metamagic feats, adding their effects to the list of possible effects you can apply to spells with this ability. When casting a spell using Sacred Geometry, first determine the effective spell level of the modified spell you are attempting to cast (calculated as normal for a spell modified by metamagic feats). You can apply any number of metamagic effects to a single spell, provided you are able to cast spells of the modified spell's effective spell level. Refer to the Prime Constants table to determine the prime constants that can be used to cast a spell of the desired effective spell level. Then roll a number of d6s equal to the number of ranks you possess in Knowledge (engineering). Perform some combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division upon the numbers rolled that gives rise to one of the relevant prime constants. If you can produce one of the relevant prime constants, the spell takes effect with the declared metamagic effects, and you expend a spell slot of the unaltered spell's level. If you are unsuccessful, you fail to cast the spell, the action used to cast the spell is lost, and the spell slot is used up. The DC of any concentration check to cast a spell affected by this feat uses the effective spell level used to determine the prime constants, even though a successful casting of the spell does not expend a higher-level spell slot. For example, suppose Ezren wants to add the enlarged and empowered effects to the <i>magic missile</i> he just cast. He adds the total level increases of the metamagic effects to the spell level: 2 [empower] + 1 [enlarge] + 1 [<i>magic missile</i>'s base level] = 4, so the spell's effective level is 4. Ezren refers to the Prime Constants table, and determines that the prime constants for that effective spell level are 31, 37, and 41. Since Ezren has 5 ranks in Knowledge (engineering), he rolls 5d6. The results of his dice pool are 6, 6, 4, 3 and 1. He then performs the following operations to give rise to one of the prime constants he needs: (6 x 6) + (4 - 3) x 1 = 37. Note that he could also combine the numbers as follows: ([6 + 6] x 3) + 4 + 1 = 41. He has produced one of the prime constants for the desired effective spell level, so his empowered enlarged <i>magic missile</i> takes effect after the full-round casting time, and uses only a 1st-level spell slot. If the result of Ezren's dice pool were 1, 1, 2, and 5, he would have been unable to produce any of the relevant prime constants. His attempt would have been unsuccessful, and he would have expended a full-round action and his prepared 1st-level <i>magic missile</i> spell with no effect.</h5></div>"},

Doing so adds both a somatic component (if the spell does not already have one) and a focus component (the harrow deck) to the spell, but does not increase the spell's casting time. For the duration of the spell, each summoned creature gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the corresponding ability scores of the drawn card's suits. If both cards are the same suit, each summoned creature gains a +6 bonus to that ability score instead. If either card's alignment is a true match for the summoned creatures' alignment, the duration of the spell is doubled, while drawing an opposite match halves the duration of the spell. If both a true match and an opposite match are drawn, the spell's duration is unchanged. A creature summoned in this way is distinctly altered by the cards drawn. Its physical appearance ref lects the visual elements of the cards (for example, a creature summoned with The Publican might have only one eye). The creature's personality is also inf luenced by the cards, but not so much as to alter its alignment (for example, The Snakebite might summon a creature that likes to gossip).</h5></div>"},

Harrow cards are treated as masterwork weapons when thrown using this feat, but are still destroyed after they are thrown. A harrow deck can no longer be used as a fortune-telling device after even a single card is thrown. A spellcaster with this feat can enhance a deck of cards as though it were a ranged weapon with 54 pieces of ammunition. This enhancement functions only when used in tandem with this feat, and has no affect on any other way the cards might be used.

new Feat(){ Name = "Elemental Commixture", Description = @"<link rel=""stylesheet""href=""PF.css""><div class=""heading""><p class=""alignleft"">Elemental Commixture (Teamwork)</p><div style=""clear: both;""></div></div><div><h5>You can combine your elemental spells with those of your allies to produce entirely new and synergistic magical effects.<h5><b>Prerequisites: </b>Caster level 1st.</h5><h5><b>Benefit: </b>You and an ally within 30 feet who shares this feat can cast your spells together to create a more powerful, hybrid effect. Both spells must have an elemental descriptor (air, earth, fire, or water), or an energy descriptor that corresponds to one of the elements (acid [earth], cold [water], electricity [air], or fire [fire]) . Both spells must be at least 1st level, within 1 spell level of each other, and cast during the same initiative turn through the use of readied actions. When the spells to be commixed are cast, one is designated as the primary spell (typically the higherlevel spell), while the other is the secondary spell. The primary spell must be an offensive spell that targets an area or one or more creatures. The secondary spell can be any spell with an appropriate descriptor. Neither spell can take more than a standard action to cast. The primary spell behaves as written (with the exception of the synergistic benefits that are described below). The secondary spell does not manifest any of its usual effects; instead, targeted creatures are affected by a secondary effect that is determined by the combination of the two spells' descriptors. Targeted creatures can attempt a saving throw against the primary spell as normal (assuming that a save is normally allowed), and then attempt a separate save against the secondary effect. The secondary effect's save type is described in its listing, and its save DC is equal to the normal save DC of the primary or secondary spell, whichever is lower (or, if neither spell allows a saving throw, 10 + lowest spell's level + spellcaster's primary spellcasting ability score [Int, Wis, or Cha] modifier). Commixed spells cannot be counterspelled normally. A creature with Improved Counterspell can counterspell commixed spells if both spells are correctly identified and both belong to the same school. Regardless, the secondary effects of two spells combined through Elemental Commixture cannot be counterspelled. Spell resistance still applies to the secondary effect, unless both of the commixed spells bypass spell resistance. Synergistic Benefits: The primary spell's save DC (if any) increases by 1. If either spell is normally modified by Spell Focus or Greater Spell Focus, the bonus to save DCs granted by those feats stacks with this increase. The caster of the primary spell also gains a +1 bonus on any caster level check made to overcome spell resistance. Secondary Effects: While the secondary spell has no direct effect other than bolstering the effects of the primary spell, the combination of spells also creates a unique secondary effect depending on the elemental descriptors of the commixed spells. For the purpose of this secondary effect, the acid, cold, and electricity descriptors count as earth, water, and air descriptors, respectively. Commixed spells with the same elemental descriptors do not produce a secondary effect, though the primary spell still gains the synergistic benefits described above. <br>&#8226; <i>Dust (Air/Earth)</i>: Choked by dust, the targets must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round plus 1 round per 5 caster levels of the secondary spell's caster. Targeted spellcasters must succeed at a concentration check to cast spells (the DC is equal to the save DC). On a successful save, the targets are not staggered but must still attempt concentration checks. <br>&#8226; <i>Lava (Earth/Fire)</i>: The targets are splattered with bits of molten rock and take 1d6 points of fire damage. The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or catch fire (see Catching on Fire on page 444 of the <i>Pathfinder RPG Core</i> Rulebook). <br>&#8226; <i>Mud (Earth/Water)</i>: The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone and have their movement speeds cut in half (to a minimum speed of 5 feet) for 1 round plus 1 round per 5 caster levels of the secondary spell's caster. On a successful save, the targets' movement speeds are cut in half for 1 round. <br>&#8226; <i>Smoke (Air/Fire)</i>: The targets suffer smoke inhalation and must succeed at Fortitude saves or become nauseated for 1 round and blinded for 1d4 rounds. Success negates the nausea effect and reduces the blindness to 1 round. Creatures immune to fire are immune to the nausea effect. <br>&#8226; <i>Snow (Air/Water)</i>: The primary spell gains the cold descriptor if it doesn't have that descriptor already, and half the damage dealt (if any) is cold damage. The targets must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone. <br>&#8226; <i>Steam (Fire/Water)</i>: Damage caused by the primary spell (if any) is treated as nonlethal, untyped damage (neither cold nor fire damage) and is not affected by energy resistance or absorbed by <i>protection from energy</i>. The targets become blinded for 1d4 rounds unless they succeed at a Will save.</h5><h5><b>Special: </b>An inquisitor or any other character with the solo tactics class feature can use this teamwork feat without the aid of an ally. In order to do so, the character must be able to cast two qualifying spells within the same round, such as by using the Quicken Spell metamagic feat to cast one spell as a swift action or by using0 effects such as the <i>time stop</i> spell.</h5></div>"},

If your shot misses the target, you must immediately make a second attack roll with all the same modifiers against the abettor, potentially hitting her with the attack instead of the opponent.

Both you and the recipient of the piercing (if not yourself) must be present for the entire piercing process.  Shadow piercings must be placed in a part of the body normally associated with a magic item slot, but they do not take up a slot on the body, nor interfere with other magic items that use those slots. A single slot can only hold one shadow piercing (nonmagical piercings do not count against this limit). Shadow piercings can be applied to the following slots: belt, body, chest, eyes, feet, hands, head, neck, shoulder, and wrist.   A single slot can hold multiple physical piercings, though the pieces of jewelry operate as a single item and must be created for that purpose. Shadow piercings have different levels of power: minor, major, and greater. Minor shadow piercings usually include one piece of jewelry, while major and greater shadow piercings often are made up of multiple rings and spikes that cover the entire area of the piercing's slot (but are still considered a single item). A creature can only use a number of shadow piercings equal its Constitution modifier plus its Wisdom modifier.  Carefully inserting or removing a shadow piercing takes a full-round action and deals no damage. Alternatively, a shadow piercing may be pulled out of a creature using the steal maneuver as a standard action that deals 1d6 points of damage. Only a creature with the Craft Shadow Piercing feat may create or insert a shadow piercing, but any creature may remove one. Inserting a shadow piercing is impossible unless the target is willing or helpless. After being removed, a shadow piercing may be inserted into another creature by someone with this feat. Since they are treated as magic items, they are affected by <i>dispel magic</i>.  Shadow piercings follow the rules for magic item creation, except the creator can use the Craft (jewelry) skill instead of Spellcraft. New shadow piercings can be researched and designed using the rules for pricing new magic items. Shadow piercing powers for a specific slot must be thematically similar or linked. Since shadow piercings don't interfere with other magic items in the same slot, but can only have one piercing per slot, the base price is multiplied by 1.5 instead of doubled as if they had no space limitation.</h5></div>"},

When that character unleashes a simple blast, yours is triggered, creating a composite blast for which the two simple blasts meet the prerequisites. The composite blast's caster level is equal to the average of the caster levels of both participants and deals damage as the  appropriate composite blast created by a kineticist of that level (for example, if a 10th-level pyrokineticist and a 6th-level hydrokineticist worked together to create a steam blast, its base damage would be 4d6+4 points of fire damage and 4d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage).  One participant can provide a form infusion appropriate for the composite blast, and the other can provide an appropriate substance infusion. Each participant accepts the burn cost for the infusion she provided. The participant who didn't take the special ready action can apply a metakinesis to the blast, and she is the only one who can gather power to reduce the blast's cost (since only she has a move action to take prior to the blast). However, whatever metakinesis she applies affects the entire composite blast.  If the two participants aren't adjacent to each other, the origin point of cones, lines, and other effects that normally originate from a character's square instead originate from a point in the square located halfway between the two participants in a straight line (where the two simple blasts meet and form the composite blast).  The blast uses the Constitution modifier of whoever provided the substance infusion and the Dexterity modifier of whoever provided the form infusion. If the blast includes only one infusion, the blast uses the Constitution or Dexterity modifier of the kineticist who supplied that infusion, as appropriate for the infusion provided. If no infusions are used, the two kineticists choose one of them to provide the Dexterity modifier, and the other provides the Constitution modifier.</h5></div>"},

You perform an 8-hour ritual that requires the expenditure of 200 gp for rare oils, incense, and creation of a special mask. After this ritual, you forever lose all names and identities previously associated with you (including any identities that you gain from class abilities). You adopt a brief descriptive title in place of a new name. Your title must not reference the names of any people or places.

While you're wearing this mask, any attempts to scry or otherwise locate any of your eschewed identities or connect you to those identities do not work, revealing nothing but darkness, as if you were an invalid target or did not exist. Successful Knowledge checks to identify you reveal your new title rather than any old identity, but can reveal your strengths and weaknesses normally.

In addition, you cannot attempt to impersonate a specific individual by any means, magical or nonmagical. If you ever reveal or confirm your connection to your eschewed identities, you immediately lose the benefit of this feat and gain 1d4 permanent negative levels as your discarded identities return.

Once you've called for a truce, if any of your allies attack or take any threatening action against those you are entreating before the start of your next turn, your call is unsuccessful. At the start of your next turn, attempt a single Diplomacy check (DC = 30 + the Charisma modifier of the creature with the highest Charisma modifier in the opposing group).

The attempt to hide the spell slows your casting slightly, such that spells that normally take a standard action to cast now take a full-round action, and spells that normally take longer than a standard action take twice as long. (Swift action spells still take a swift action.) To discover your ruse, a creature must succeed at a Perception, Sense Motive, or Spellcraft check (the creature receives an automatic check with whichever of those skills has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Bluff or Disguise (whichever is higher) + your Charisma modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability you are concealing.  If your spell has a somatic component, any creature that can see you receives a Perception or Spellcraft check (whichever has the highest bonus) against a DC equal to 15 + your number of ranks in Sleight of Hand + your Dexterity modifier; the creature gains a bonus on its check equal to the level of the spell or spell-like ability you are concealing.  Since you are concealing the spell's manifestation through other actions, others observing you realize you're doing something, even if they don't realize you're casting a spell. If there is a verbal component, they still hear your  loud, clear voice but don't notice the spell woven within. If an opponent fails its check, your casting also does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and an opponent that fails its check can't use readied actions that depend on realizing that you're casting a spell or using a spell-like ability, or readied actions such as counterspelling that require identifying the spell you're casting. Spells such as <i>fireball</i> that create an additional obvious effect (aside from the manifestation of casting that all spells and spell-like abilities share) still create that effect, though it might not be obvious who cast the spell unless it emanates from you.  If a character interacts with you long enough to attempt a Sense Motive check without realizing you have been casting spells, that character can use Sense Motive to gain a hunch that you're behaving unusually.</h5></div>"},

The ally must have remained adjacent throughout the process of disabling the device and must have either aided your Disable Device check or taken no other action.

A threatening illusion spell causes one target to believe your illusion is a threat. Choose one 5-foot square within the area of your illusion; that square threatens the target as long as it is adjacent. Thus, if you or an ally is on the opposite side of the target, it is considered flanking. Normally the area must contain an illusory creature of Small or Medium size. However, you can select one square of a larger illusory creature to threaten the target. For example, an illusory Large ogre takes up four 5-foot squares; you select one square to be the source of the threat, and its other three squares do not threaten anyone. If the target has reason to believe there is an invisible creature in the vicinity, even an auditory illusion with no visual elements (such as <i>ghost</i> sound) is sufficient to convince the target that the selected square contains an actual threat. As long as you maintain the illusion, you can change the location of the threatening square as a swift action. When you threaten a target with this spell, the foe may make a Will save to disbelieve (DC 10 + threatening spell's level + your spellcasting ability score modifier).

The creature targeted must succeed at a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier or be possessed (see below). Targets under the effects of <i>protection from evil</i>, or related spells, gain a bonus to this save. Should a target succeed at its Will save, the fiend is forced back into its natural form and is stunned for 1 round. A fiend that successfully possesses a target enters its space and merges with it. While possessing a creature or object, a fiend's body and abilities are unavailable. Once a fiend merges with its target it cannot be harmed until it leaves or is forcibly removed. While possessing a target, a fiend shares the senses of its host and can communicate with it telepathically. A fiend also gains a number of possession points per day equal to its total Hit Dice. These points can be spent to utilize special bodily possession actions detailed on the following pages. A fiend may expend these points as it pleases, with each possession action taking a full-round action. Each day, the victim of a possession is allowed a new Will save at the original DC to force the possessing fiend to leave its body-objects and areas do not receive daily saves. Should a victim make this save or be killed, the fiend is ejected, retakes its original form in an adjacent space, and is stunned for 1 round.

This area is spherical, so a fiend possessing a particularly large structure might only have power over a certain number of rooms. An area receives no save against fiendish possession unless creatures or magical items occupy the space, in which case the area makes a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier using the stats of the occupant with the highest Will save. An area within the effects of a <i>hallow</i> spell cannot be possessed. A fiend possessing an area operates similarly to one using the Possess Creature feat, except that locations do not receive daily saves to escape the fiend's influence and the fiend's possession points can only be spent on location possession actions.

Unattended, a mundane object receives no saving throw against possession, while an attended object uses its owner's saving throw to make a Will save equal to 10 + half the fiend's Hit Dice + the fiend's Charisma modifier. Magic items save as if they were subject to a spell. Items within the area of effect of a <i>hallow</i> spell cannot be possessed. This effect is similar to that detailed in the Possess Creature feat, except that objects do not receive a daily save to escape the fiend's influence and the fiend's possession points can only be spent on object-possession actions.

This decision must be made as a free action as the vampire slays the animal with its blood drain or energy drain ability. The animal rises from death in 1d4 days as a vampiric animal bonded with the vampire who spawned it. Thereafter, the vampiric animal advances in abilities like a normal animal companion as the vampire gains further class levels in the class that granted the animal companion. In order to gain a dire rat as a vampiric companion, a vampire's effective druid level must be 4th. To gain a wolf as an vampiric companion, the vampire's effective druid level must be 6th. To gain a dire bat vampiric companion, the vampire's effective druid level must be 9th. At your option, additional animals could be added to this list-use these examples as guides to set minimum levels. Vampiric animal companions count toward the total number of Hit Dice a vampire may enslave, as well as toward the limit of animal companions the character may have at any one time. Any vampiric animal companion the vampire creates that would exceed such limits becomes a free-willed undead. A vampire may also free a vampiric companion in order to enslave a new one, but once freed, the vampiric animal cannot be enslaved again.

Additionally, by meditating and inflicting strenuous reckonings upon yourself, you unlock the power behind your order's doctrine. Each Hellknight order has its own unique reckoning-a trial of obedience and pain (described in general on page 9 and in the Reckoning entries of the Hellknight order stat blocks throughout this book). When coupled with the necessary reflection and meditation, this reckoning takes 1 hour per day to perform. Once you have performed your order's reckoning, you gain the benefit of a special ability as indicated in the Reckoning entry for the Hellknight order to which you've sworn allegiance.  If you have at least 12 Hit Dice, you also gain the first boon granted by the Hellknight order. If you have at least 16 Hit Dice, you also gain the Hellknight order's second boon.

Members of the Order of the Nail often install a sharp barb within their armor that deals this damage when the wearer is subject to a critical hit (see page 28); if you're struck by a critical hit while wearing such armor, using this ability doesn't require a swift action.  <i>Fervor</i>: The DCs to resist the effects of the boons granted by your Hellknight Obedience feat increase by 1 for 1 hour.  <i>Indomitability</i>: You can reroll a single failed Will saving throw and must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse.

You must understand the language the creature is speaking, and if it's of a different type than you, you take a -5 penalty on the check. If the creature is attempting to conceal its loyalties, it attempts a Bluff check. If the result of the Bluff check is higher than 20, that result becomes the DC of your Sense Motive check. On a success, you learn whether the creature has a patron god, a witch patron, or a government to which it is strongly loyal. You can attempt to name one specific god, patron, or government for every 2 ranks you have in Sense Motive by introducing them into the conversation as subjects, as noted below.  You can use this ability only if you observe the creature in an environment where loyalty to a god, government, leader, or patron is being discussed. If this isn't already occurring, you can introduce the topic, but doing so may expose your interest. In this case, the creature you are observing and any other creatures able to hear you bring up the topic of loyalty to a god, government, leader, or patron can attempt Sense Motive checks (opposed by a Bluff check from you, which the GM rolls in secret). On a success, the creature realizes you are interested in determining the observed creature's specific loyalty. If you are attempting to determine whether the observed creature's loyalty is to a specific god, government, or leader as noted above, creatures who succeed at the Sense Motive check are aware of the specific god, government, leader, or patron about which you are interesting in learning.</h5></div>"},

This feat can be applied only to spell-like abilities with the emotion or fear descriptor. Targets that avoid the spell-like ability's effects avoid this feat's effect as well.  You can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 your caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see Table 3-1.</h5><h5><b>Special: </b>This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, you are able to apply it to a different spell-like ability.</h5></div>"},

Whenever you encounter a recently neutralized haunt, the remains of an incorporeal undead creature, or the remains of a creature that has the ability to possess another creature using a racial spell-like ability or supernatural ability (such as a ghost or a shadow demon), you can attempt to extract material components from those remains that are suitable for crafting magic items. You must have access to an alchemist's lab (<i>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment</i> 76) in order to extract components from a haunt or creature, and you must begin extracting these components within 10 minutes of the haunt or creature's death or destruction. After 10 minutes, the components have degraded too much to be of any use to you.  Harvesting components with this feat can take several hours. Performing at least 1 minute of work extracting components from a haunt or creature prevents its material components from degrading further for 24 hours, allowing you to safely suspend and resume harvesting these components without fear of subsequent degradation. This ectoplasmic residue is portable once the extraction work begins, provided you have a vial to contain the source residue (the actual amount of residue is never much, physically, but the value of the components you can extract from the residue increases with the power of the original haunt or creature).  Each hour, attempt a Craft (alchemy) or a Knowledge (religion) check to successfully handle the residue and extract useful material. The DC for this check is equal to 15 + the CR of the haunt or creature being harvested. If you succeed at the check, you harvest 50 gp worth of components. If you fail the check by 4 or less, you can attempt to harvest those components again. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the residue spoils and you cannot scavenge any more from that particular source. A single source can yield an amount of components up to a maximum value of 50 gp per point of CR before it is depleted.  Material components harvested with Haunt Scavenger can be used in place of the material components of enchantment or necromancy spells and extracts, provided they are of equal or greater value compared to the spell's normal material components.
